Twitter has suggested people to follow for years. Since the ill-fated Suggested User List, which led to a small number of celebrities like Ashton Kutcher gaining an extreme number of followers in the early days, Twitter has tried to be more strategic in the way they recommend new accounts. This is a logical progression in their ongoing effort to suggest people you might want to Tweet with.
