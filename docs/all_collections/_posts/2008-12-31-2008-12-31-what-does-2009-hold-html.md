<div src="v5">Well another year has come and gone in what feels like the blink of an eye. How does this always happen? Even when you try to slow down, take it easy, and enjoy things, they manage to rush past you anyway. Well, 2008 was a pretty good year. I’m not about to sit here and count down the Top 10 Best [Insert Category Here] of 2008; I’ll leave that to Oprah, Barbara Walters and their ilk. Nor will I list a number of resolutions I don’t intend to stick to. So heave a sigh of relief. Instead, I’m just giving you a few things to look forward to in the year 2009. Here’s what I’ll be watching out for in the new year:

- <span style="font-weight: bold;">The return of <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallville</span></span> – Two weeks from tomorrow, the CW’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallville</span> will return to the airwaves with what promises to be a story of epic proportions. DC Comics writer Geoff Johns has penned an episode entitled “Legion” that will introduce the Legion of Super-Heroes to <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallville</span> continuity. It should be amazing. If you don’t watch the show, you are missing out big-time!
- <span style="font-weight: bold;">The DTV transition</span> – Okay, so I’m a dork. Sue me. As someone who has never had cable at home and doesn’t really care, I’m looking forward to this. I’ve had my converter boxes set up for a few months now, and let me say <span style="font-style: italic;">wow</span>! First off, I had no idea broadcast television could look and sound so amazing! It’s quite a thing. Second, I get some very interesting digital channels that I didn’t have before. It’s pretty cool. I’m looking forward to new channels once the switch is complete.
- <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Watchmen, Star Trek &amp; Terminator: Salvation</span> – These movies top the lists of most geeks this year. How much awesome can one year contain? We shall see. Recently I was disappointed to hear that <span style="font-style: italic;">Watchmen</span> will not end the same way the graphic novel did, but I still really want to see it. <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Trek</span>, while also straying from its source material, also has me excited. Terminator, on the other hand, is an original story, so I look forward to seeing where they take the franchise.
- <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Superman: Secret Origin</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Blackest Night</span> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">– </span>It’s a coincidence that both of these comic book events are written by Geoff Johns and that they will both be awesome. Oh wait. That’s not a coincidence at all! Johns is the best writer in the business right now. I really believe that. The former is supposed to be the definitive origins story for the Man of Steel. It will help DC out of any corners they may have written themselves into. The latter will be a Green Lantern story dealing with the fundamentals of good versus evil. Such an epic year for comics!

Well that about sums things up. Obviously there’s a lot more I’m looking forward to, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Heroes, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</span>, and catching up on shows like <span style="font-style: italic;">Supernatural </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>most of, if not all of the Whedonverse. So stay tuned, it’s going to be one hell of a year.

Happy New Year and God bless you all in 2009 and beyond!
