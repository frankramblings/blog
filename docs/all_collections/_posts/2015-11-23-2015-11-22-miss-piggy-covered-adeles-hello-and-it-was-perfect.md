The Muppets always bring their A-game when it comes to parody videos, so it’s no small for them to outdo themselves. And yet, that’s exactly what we’re looking at here. This might be the most relevant thing I’ve ever seen from them. If only *The Muppets* show itself was delivering this level of quality with some level of consistency. The shelf life on this video will sadly probably be short, but that’s all the more reason to enjoy the hell out of it now while it’s still timely.
