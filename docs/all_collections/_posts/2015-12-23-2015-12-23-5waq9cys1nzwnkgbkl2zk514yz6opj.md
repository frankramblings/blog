The rumors are apparently true. Google is testing a method that lets users log in without using a password. A user on Reddit who is part of the beta posted screenshots outlining the way it works.

> <span>‚Äú</span>Once a user authorizes their mobile device, they‚Äôre able to input their account credentials on any computer and receive a notification on their smartphone. The device must have some type of screen lock security feature, as unlocking your phone is a prerequisite to approving or denying access to the account with this method. You‚Äôre still given the option to log in with your regular password if you so choose. Google‚Äôs email to participating users explains how you can deactivate a lost device, as well as add a new one in the event you upgrade your handset.<span>‚Äù</span>
