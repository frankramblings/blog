George Martin will be remembered as the ‚ÄúFifth Beatle,‚Äù and nothing could be more fitting. His ability to listen and mentor the Beatles was unparalleled. In the early days he would listen to what they brought into the studio and advise them on how to make a hit. As time went on, they would come to him, describe the new and different sounds they wanted, and he would use his musical and technical expertise to make it happen. Even after the band broke up, he continued to work with them, producing, orchestrating, and arranging music for them as solo artists. He won 4 Grammys and an Oscar for his work with the Beatles. Though he lived 90 years, his contributions will continue to live on for as long as people are still listening to the Beatles.
