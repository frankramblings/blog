<div src="v5">Lately my passion for the Beatles has been flaring up again in a big way. Rather than blog about it to no end here and tweet about it on my[ main Twitter account](http://twitter.com/frankramblings), I decided it made more sense to create a new outlet to channel my thoughts on all things Beatlish. The result is [@BeatleRamblings](http://twitter.com/beatleramblings) paired with [beatleramblings.tumblr.com](http://beatleramblings.tumblr.com). I’ll be giving my spur-of-the-moment thoughts, comments, and reactions on the Twitter account, and blogging and sharing links, pictures, and other media on the Tumblr page. I’m also looking into starting a Beatles podcast. More on that at a later date. For now, please follow, friend, and comment. Thanks!</div>
