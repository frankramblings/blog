![Two lucky nerds admiring a LEGO Saturn V]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2017/07/apollo.jpg)
My eyes lit up when I heard this was now available. Another great set to come from the LEGO Ideas program. My favorite part is that once assembled, it actually breaks into stages like the real Saturn IV used in the Apollo missions. Plus, at over 3 feet tall, the thing is huge! Anyone want to help me convince my wife that $120 is worth it?
