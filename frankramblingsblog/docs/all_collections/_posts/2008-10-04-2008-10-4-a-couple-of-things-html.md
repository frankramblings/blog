<div src="v5">At this moment I will do anything to avoid studying for this ethics   
midterm. Part one is on Monday. It’s on terms and definitions. The   
prof refused to specify whether it would be written, multiple choice,   
or something else. He’s kind of annoying like that. So I think I’ll   
make a list of the definitions be gave us and try to learn them as   
best I can. In other news, I got paid yesterday! It was my first check from this   
new writing center tutoring job. I am happy. Now I don’t have to   
worry quite so much about cash all the time. That’ll make my weekly   
trips to the comics shop a little easier on the wallet. I don’t spend   
much on comics anyway, but it’s nice to know that I have something of   
an income.

As I mentioned yesterday, the new Star Wars: Clone Wars series   
premiered last night. Luckily I was able to see it just about an hour   
after it aired. Wow. A LOT better than the movie. The movie felt   
childish and silly, and while last night’s episodes were suitable for   
young fans, they were still somehow better than the film. It felt more   
like the creators were taking themselves and the material seriously. I   
really enjoyed it. It was especially great to see Yoda act like the   
mischievous sage everyone loved in Empire Strikes Back. Just great. It   
was also interesting to finally see in action a Jedi that fans have   
heard so much about ever since the prequels were launched: Master Plo   
Koon. He was awesome. A no-nonsense, confident guy who never loses his   
cool and solves even the most lethal conundrums with simple logic and,   
of course, the use of the Force. He reminds me of Mace Windu (Samuel   
L. Jackson’s character, for anyone who’s not all that big on SW).   
Overall, I look forward to the 5 planned seasons of this exciting new   
series based on one of my all-time favorite sci-fi sagas.

As for Making Fiends, which premiered this morning, I still haven’t   
been able to find it anywhere on the web. I’m not really surprised by   
this, as it probably doesn’t have a big enough following to warrant   
recording and uploading, plus it’s on a channel watched mostly by   
kids. Still, I had hoped someone would have uploaded it somewhere,   
since it does have a decent-sized Internet fan base. Oh well I’ll keep   
looking. If anyone knows where I can find it, lemme no.

Well I guess I should get to work. Just saying it doesn’t mean I won’t   
find some other distraction first, but at least it’s a step in the   
right direction.  
Peace.
