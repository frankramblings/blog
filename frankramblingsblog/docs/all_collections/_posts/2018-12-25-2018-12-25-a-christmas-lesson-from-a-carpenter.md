This Christmas, I’m struck by the humility that this day represents.

God chose to take human form.

He chose to be born to a family living in poverty.

He chose to be born in a country occupied by a hostile empire.

He chose to be born in a stable that smelled like farm animals.

He chose to be laid in a food trough for those animals.

As a child, “He was subject to” Mary and Joseph.

God himself grew up as the apprentice to a simple carpenter.

He fetched water. He tended to the fireplace. He swept the floor.

So that’s what I’m thinking about today. If the God of the universe was humble enough to make himself so lowly, I need to remember to be more humble too.

Merry Christmas!
