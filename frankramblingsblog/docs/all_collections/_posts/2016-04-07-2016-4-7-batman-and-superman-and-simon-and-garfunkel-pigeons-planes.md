This meme is the best thing to come out of *Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.* The movie wasn’t very good, and its misunderstanding of Superman and Batman is abysmal, but at least this meme inspired by the movie has launched *The Sound of Silence* to #6 on the Billboard chart.

> <span>“</span>Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s classic 1966 song “The Sound of Silence” has jumped up into the Billboard Rock Top 10 chart because of a meme. And a beautiful meme at that. “Sad Affleck” has taken the internet by storm and racked up nearly 22 million views on YouTube in just two weeks. The video shows a dejected Ben Affleck learning about the horrible reviews Batman V Superman is receiving. “The Sound of Silence” comes in while Affleck stares at the ground, reflecting on every decision he’s ever made in his life.<span>”</span>
