This feels like the right move. The sequel trilogy wouldn’t be complete without one last appearance from our princess. I hope they do her memory justice.

> Todd Fisher, the late actress’ brother \[…\] and Carrie’s daughter, Billie Lourd, have granted the studio rights to use recent footage for the finale. Todd isn’t sure to what extent she will appear, but he has faith in the film makers and thinks the people deserve to have her.
