Maybe Instagram should create an iPad app and add the ability to manage multiple Instagram accounts before killing off third-party apps that meet people’s needs. Yes, Instagram needs to monetize their app with ads (which aren’t visible in third-party apps) and they want to launch new apps like Hyperlapse and Boomerang, but killing these apps without offering useful alternatives just worsens the customer experience for power users. And for iPad users.

“Going forward, Instagram’s platform will only permit photo editing apps and ones like Tinder that let you pull in your own Instagrams (but not your feed), brand and ad management apps, and tools for media and broadcasters. Existing apps will need to comply by June 1st, 2016, and the policies and reviews will go into effect for new apps starting December 3rd, 2015.”
