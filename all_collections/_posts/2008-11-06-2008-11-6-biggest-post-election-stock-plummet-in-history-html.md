For those not yet convinced that President-Elect Obama’s economic policies are bad for the country, consider this. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 486 points, or 5% today in the biggest post-election stock market slip in history.

Interesting, isn’t it? Incidentally, last Saturday, CNBC’s Larry Kudlow predicted a 1000-point Dow rally the day after a McCain victory. While this prediction doesn’t necessarily mean that’s what would have happened, it is interesting to note that upon the election of the candidate who promised economic stability and prosperity, the market took a historic turn for the worse. What does Wall Street know that we don’t know? Hmm? Or maybe we *do* know, but were so mesmerized by a man who never says anything that we voted foolishly. Yeah, maybe that’s it.
