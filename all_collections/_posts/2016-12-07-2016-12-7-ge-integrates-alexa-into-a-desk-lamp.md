[The first third-party integration of Alexa comes from GE,](http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13859092/ge-made-a-circular-lamp-with-alexa-in-it?utm_campaign=theverge&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) and it looks pretty cool. If I didn’t *just* get an Echo Dot a week ago, I’d be clamoring for a release date here. It makes a lot of sense for GE to get into this space, especially when you consider their involvement in the household appliance space. It would be a great experience to have your oven, your fridge, and your washer/dryer connected to Alexa.
