Walt Mossberg outlines the 7 things he’d like to see in the next iPhone, and his list looks a lot like mine. Especially better battery life, durability, and fast charging. I’d love it if I didn’t need a phone case, either for protection or added battery life. Just add wireless charging to this list and you’d have a near-perfect device.

>	or who, like me, have great cell tower proximity, which keeps 
>	the phone from battery-draining tower searches. But I know too 
>	many iPhone users who are forced to recharge their phones multiple 
>	times a day or carry around bulky extra-battery cases or portable 
>	chargers. Apple even brought out such a case itself recently. 
>	Fixing battery life would be a huge win.”
