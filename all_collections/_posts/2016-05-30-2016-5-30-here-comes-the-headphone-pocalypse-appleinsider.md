Amid rumors of an iPhone 7 that eliminates the headphone jack, a Chinese accessory manufacturer is showing off a new lightning-to-headphone adapter. Not an absolute indicator of things to come, but it does add fuel to the fire. As someone who has been using Bluetooth headphones exclusively for over a year now, it makes me wonder: if Apple does go this route, will everyone adopt Bluetooth headphones? Or will Apple make a killing off of $29 lightning adapters?
