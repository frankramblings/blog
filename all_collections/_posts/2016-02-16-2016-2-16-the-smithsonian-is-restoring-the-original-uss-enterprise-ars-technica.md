The Smithsonian is in the process of restoring the 1967 model of the *Enterprise* used in the original *Star Trek* series. Anybody want to take a road trip to DC?

>	"The restoration is specifically aiming to restore the model to look as it did 
>	during the filming of the episode The Trouble with Tribbles, aka the 
>	“last known modification of the ship during the production of Star Trek.” 
>	By Summer 2016, the Enterprise is scheduled to move to the Boeing 
>	Milestones of Flight Hall."
