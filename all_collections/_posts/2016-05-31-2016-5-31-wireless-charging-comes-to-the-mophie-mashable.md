I’ve been a fan of wireless charging for a couple of years now. First Duracell Powermat and now the open Qi standard. It’s pretty easy to find cases or case inserts that make your iPhone compatible with wireless charging pads, and of course many Android and Windows Phones come with wireless charging built in. Apple is rumored to be considering this for the next iPhone, but in the meantime, Mophie is adding it to their battery cases.

This strikes me as a very smart move on Mophie’s part for a couple of reasons. First of all, accessory manufacturers have flooded the market with battery cases, driving down the prices consumers are willing to pay. Mophie needed to do something to differentiate their premium-priced products. Secondly, it seems to me that if Apple *does* add wireless charging to the next iPhone, this is a great way to bring that feature to iPhone 6/6s owners.

All in all, I say bravo, Mophie. It’s not clear whether this case is compatible with the existing Qi standard, but that would make me seriously consider picking up one of these bad boys.
