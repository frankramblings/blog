[This week on Supergirl TV Talk](http://www.supergirltvtalk.com/2016/10/2x02-last-children-of-krypton.html), Snapper Carr and Metallo bring Frank and Tim lots to talk about. Frank has a bombshell prediction, and the guys share their final Cat Grant Quote of the Week…for now! Maybe there’s a Snappy new segment on the horizon? Plus your emails, trailer analysis and speculation. Enjoy!
