Barbara West of Orlando’s Eyewitness News WFTV-Channel 9 recently interviewed Sen. Joe Biden, asking him to respond to accusations that Sen. Obama’s policies are Marxist:

>	 at best for the duration of the remaining days until the election.” 

I applaud Ms. West and WFTV for asking the questions we’re all dying to have answered. I love how much her calm demeanor bothered Biden, who was visibly hot under the collar and really wanted to tell her off. It clearly took all his willpower not to explode and start ranting about [how high his IQ is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyEqyYUGk4I) or [making racist remarks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM19YOqs7hU&feature=related).
