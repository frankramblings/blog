The rumors are apparently true. Google is testing a method that lets users log in without using a password. A user on Reddit who is part of the beta posted screenshots outlining the way it works.

>	‚ÄúOnce a user authorizes their mobile device, they‚Äôre able to input 
>	their account credentials on any computer and receive a notification 
>	on their smartphone. The device must have some type of screen lock 
>	security feature, as unlocking your phone is a prerequisite to approving 
>	or denying access to the account with this method. You‚Äôre still given 
>	the option to log in with your regular password if you so choose. 
>	Google‚Äôs email to participating users explains how you can deactivate 
>	a lost device, as well as add a new one in the event you upgrade 
>	your handset.‚Äù
