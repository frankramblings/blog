Jason Snell writes on Yahoo! Tech today that one of the astronomers who helped bring our solar system down to 8 planets may be building a case to bring it back up to 9.

>	A decade ago Mike Brown helped get Pluto demoted from a “planet” 
>	to a mere “dwarf planet.” Now the astronomer and one of his CalTech 
>	colleagues may have plotted the orbit of a new ninth planet in our 
>	solar system, dramatically larger than Pluto and much, much farther away.
