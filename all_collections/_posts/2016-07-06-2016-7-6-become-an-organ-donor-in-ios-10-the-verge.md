[This is a really interesting move](http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/5/12095924/ios-10-beta-organ-donor-registration-apple), in keeping with Apple’s recent trend towards health. I can’t help but wonder if Steve Jobs’s own liver transplant inspired this feature.

Facebook has been encouraging organ donation since 2013, and just a day after they launched that functionality, [Johns Hopkins](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/the_facebook_effect_social_media_dramatically_boosts_organ_donor_registration) reported a 21-fold uptick in interest. I can only wonder what impact Apple’s feature will have on increasing awareness. Either way, I applaud them for their continued commitment to such noble causes.
