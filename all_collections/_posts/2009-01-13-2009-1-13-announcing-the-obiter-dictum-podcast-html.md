Well folks, one podcast just isn’t enough to keep me overwhelmed. A few friends and I have teamed up to form a brand new podcast that we like to call “Obiter Dictum.” What is this, you ask? It’s going to be a fan commentary podcast. We’ll be watching our favorite TV shows and providing a running commentary along with the episodes for your entertainment. We’ll cover shows like Smallville, Lost, Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Heroes, Firefly, and much more! Our first official episode will cover *Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog*! I say “official” because we’ve already put out a miniature episode we’ve called #0 in which we explain the premise and introduce ourselves. I am joined by my friends Faith and Ky of the Chic Geek Podcast and Tim of the Crossroads Podcast. (Support them by checking out their shows in my Linkage section over in the right-hand column).
