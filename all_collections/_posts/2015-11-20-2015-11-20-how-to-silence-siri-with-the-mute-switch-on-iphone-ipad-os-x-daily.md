Not sure why this feature isn‚Äôt turned on by default. It would make all the sense in the world. Also not sure why it‚Äôs hidden and worded so strangely. In any case, I just did this and recommend it. Even if you don‚Äôt use Siri, it‚Äôs useful to keep her silent if you don‚Äôt want her talking to you when you accidentally enable her in a quiet room.

>	‚Äú1. Open Settings and go to ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù then to ‚ÄúSiri‚Äù 
>	2. Choose ‚ÄúVoice Feedback‚Äù and select ‚ÄúControl with
