Itâ€™s not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but there is a clear correlation between the presence of ride-sharing services and the rate of DUIs in a given city. I have my personal issues with the way Uber treats its customers and drivers, but itâ€™s hard to deny that easy access to a ride prevents poor decisions.
