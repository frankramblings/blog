Wow. I have been — to put it in my friend Andrew’s words — ” a podcasting fiend” lately. Seriously. My name is Frank and I’m a castaholic. Listening to them, recording them, I just can’t get enough. It’s an exciting medium that I think has amazing potential. For two and a half years now, I’ve run [Frank’s Music Free-For-All](http://frankpodcast.tk/). About three weeks ago, I teamed up with my friends Tim, Ky, and Faith to create the [Obiter Dictum podcast](http://odtvpodcast.tk/), a TV fan commentary show. And most recently, the aforementioned Andrew and I have started [Echo Alert](http://echoalert.tk/), a podcast devoted to the upcoming Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku series <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span>.

Today, I had the pleasure of sitting in on the [Entertainment Overload](http://fusedfilm.com/features/podcast-info/) podcast and the [Geekland ](http://www.geeklandpodcast.com/)podcast at the gracious invitation of my Twitter friend Willie. Entertainment Overload is a podcast reviewing TV, movies, video games and other entertainment. We had a great time talking about this week’s TV and movie highlights. <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallville, LOST, Scrubs</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Taken</span> were among the many topics discussed. Check out the guys and listen.

Then, on [Geekland](http://www.geeklandpodcast.com/), we talked comics. I really had a blast with this one, since comics have been a new passion for me. We covered <span style="font-style: italic;">Superman, Final Crisis, Spider-Man, Green Arrow/Black Canary, Trinity,</span> and whole host of other titles and trade paperbacks that we all read in the past week. If you like comics, please listen to Geekland. I started listening a couple of weeks ago and I honestly think the guys have a great show here.

So that’s what I’ve been up to lately. There should be a new [ODTV](http://odtvpodcast.tk/) and [FMF](http://frankpodcast.tk/) out this week, and a new [Echo Alert](http://echoalert.tk/) after next weekend. February 6-8 I will be at New York Comic Con with my friends Andrew, Tim, and Vin. It should be a good time. During and after the convention, I’ll blog my reactions to the panels and other goings-on. We plan to attend the DC Comics panels as well as a few others, including the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span> panel where show creator Joss Whedon and star Tahmoh Penikett will screen the first act of the show’s first episode. So that should give us plenty to discuss on Echo Alert. See you in the podcastverse!
