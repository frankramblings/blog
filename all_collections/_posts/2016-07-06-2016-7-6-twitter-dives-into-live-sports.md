Earlier this year, Twitter made a $10 Million deal with the NFL to livestream Thursday Night Football games this fall. Today, they’ve begun testing the new functionality that will presumably be used for that partnership. A [new page](https://twitter.com/i/live/750261221098594304) is live with a Wimbledon live video stream and a feed of tweets using the Wimbledon hashtag.

Personally, I prefer a two-screen setup, but having this all-in-one view would have been *very* useful for me a few years back. I can see college students and others who rely heavily on a laptop making the most use of this. And I’d love to see them bring it to awards shows, the World Series, and other events that dominate water cooler conversation.
