The story about Sir Alec Guinness you haven’t heard anywhere else: at age 42 he experienced a miracle that changed his life and converted him to Catholicism.

>	“He made a deal with God: if God healed his son Matthew, 
>	he would allow his son to become Catholic if he wanted. 
>	”Against all expectations (miraculously?), his son recovered! 
>	So Guinness and his wife enrolled him in a Jesuit school. 
>	A few years later, Guinness, his wife, and his son all 
>	converted to Catholicism.”
