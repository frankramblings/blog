So as many of you know, Jan 2 is my birthday. Some people think having a birthday so close to Christmas means being overshadowed by it. Personally, I rather enjoy it. It’s not as though I have a choice anyway, but I don’t mind it at all. So I thought I’d give you a little list of my Christmas &amp; Birthday presents just because I feel like it. 
- 4 GB RAM for my laptop
- *Smallville* Season 7 DVD
- *Wall-E* 3 Disc Special Edition
- *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* 2 Disc Special Edition
- *Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog* DVD
- *Superman Theatrical Serials* DVD
- *The Adventures of Superman Original TV Soundtrack* CD
- The obligatory clothes, cash &amp; gift cards

Not a bad pay day. I’m more than happy! I’ve got tons of DVDs to watch. Looking forward to seeing all of it! I’ve already listened to the Superman soundtrack and I *love* it. The music is so iconic! I could hear the sound effects from the show playing in my head as I listened. Also, the liner notes were excellent. They were written by a true fan who did his homework. They tell the story behind the music while expressing what makes the pieces so special to so many people. Great stuff!

Thanks to everyone on Twitter and Facebook for the kind birthday wishes! There were too many to respond individually. I guess I’m just too loved. 😉 But sincerely from the bottom of my heart, thanks to you all!
