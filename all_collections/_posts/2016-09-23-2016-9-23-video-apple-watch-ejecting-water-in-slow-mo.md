My Apple Watch Series 2 arrived two days ago and I haven’t had the nerve to test this feature yet. Luckily, Nathan Smart quite literally took the plunge in my place. It’s less interesting than Apple made it sound, but cool to see that it actually works! Meanwhile, I’ll be keeping my watch safe and dry for now.
