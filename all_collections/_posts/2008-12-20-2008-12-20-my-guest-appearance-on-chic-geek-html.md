<div src="v5">I just wanted to let everyone know that earlier this week, my friends Faith and Ky of the [Chic Geek Podcast](http://chicgeekpodcast.blogspot.com/) were gracious enough to invite me to join them on their thirteenth episode entitled “[How to Scare the Chic Geek Girls](http://chicgeekpodcast.blogspot.com/2008/12/episode-thirteen-how-to-scare-chic-geek.html)<span>.</span>” Also joining us was Tim of the [Crossroads Podcast](http://crossroadscast.tumblr.com/). It was a lot of fun and I’d like to thank the girls for asking me to take part in it. Show them your support by listening to the episode and subscribing to their podcast in iTunes! If all goes well, you can expect to hear Tim, Faith, and Ky on my own podcast, [Frank’s Music-Free-For-All](http://www.frankpodcast.tk), in early 2009!
