Can I just say how happy that makes me? It’s great to see a pretty major entity, Grucci, taking a stand against the war on Christmas. It really is true that the only holidays people are “offended” by are the Christian ones. Any public display of Christian religiosity makes people uncomfortable, even scared. But other religions are said to deserve the right to display religious symbols in public for their holy days. And that’s how it should be. It’s our first amendment right. But somehow that idea doesn’t apply to Christianity. If it’s unfair to exclude other religions, why is it acceptable to exclude Christians at Christmas, throwing snowmen and reindeer their way for the sake of appeasement? _All_ religions should be treated equally. This means (brace yourself for impact) saying “Merry Christmas” when appropriate, publicly displaying Nativity scenes, and saying “Easter”. Let’s be honest, people. Last year, I remember being frustrated and disgusted by a TV commercial featuring a wife and mother with her family around the Christmas tree talking about “Holiday Eve.” Seriously? Is it SO horrible to say “Christmas Eve?” Is there another religion that celebrates some other major holy day specifically on December 24? I don’t think so. Even if Dec. 24 falls during Chanukah, it’s still Christmas Eve. Also, we don’t just have “Winter Break” or “Spring Break” because the Earth is on a tilted axis that creates seasonal change. Stop ignoring the 800 pound gorilla in the room. The real reason for those breaks are Christmas and Easter. It’s okay to say it. Nothing bad will happen. Unless you have something against the equal treatment of Christians. If that’s the case, then don’t get defensive when I call you a bigot. Thank you, Grucci, for standing up against political correctness.
