<div src="v5">Those of you who know me personally might know that I believe the people who have been in charge of the Superman films from the very beginning lack a fundamental understanding of the character at his core. Kevin Smith, though, has that understanding and is outspoken about his views. Recently he said that based on the success and quality of Star Trek, he thinks J.J. Abrams should be in charge of Warner Bros./DC’s “reintroduction” of Superman. I’m a little nervous about that idea, but I think it has serious potential. <center><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" base="." flashvars="configParams=type%3Dnormal%26id%3D1611714%26vid%3D392999%26uri%3Dmgid%3Auma%3Avideo%3Amtv.com%3A392999%26startUri=mgid%3Auma%3Avideo%3Amtv.com%3A392999" height="319" src="http://media.mtvnservices.com/mgid:uma:video:mtv.com:392999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="512"></embed><div style="margin: 0pt; text-align: center; width: 500px; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">[Movie Trailers](http://www.mtv.com/movies/trailer_park/) – [Movies Blog](http://moviesblog.mtv.com/)</div></center></div>
