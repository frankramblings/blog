This is pretty timely for me, as I deleted th Facebook app from my phone earlier this week and I havenâ€™t missed it yet. I definitely havenâ€™t regularly updated my status in years, either. Most of what I see there are articles shared by my friends, plus the updates of the small group of my friends who use Facebook as though it were Twitter. If it werenâ€™t required for my job, I could probably stop using Facebook all together and I doubt Iâ€™d miss it.
