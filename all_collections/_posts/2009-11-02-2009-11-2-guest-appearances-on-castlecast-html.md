Twice in the last three weeks, I’ve guest-hosted [Castlecast](http://castlecast.libsyn.com), a podcast about ABC’s Castle (starring Nathan Fillion). I’ve been listening to the podcast since it started this summer, and I’ve really been enjoying it. [John](http://twitter.com/johnpavlich) and [Heidi](http://twitter.com/hjkuzcotopia) do a great job recapping and discussing new episodes, delivering Castle-related news, and talking about spoilers for upcoming episodes. Heidi hasn’t been able to host the show lately (feel better, Heidi!), so John’s been asking his fellow podcasters to step in. I was on the podcast two weeks ago for [Episode 9: Fool Me Once](http://castlecast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=539556) and again this week for [Episode 11: Vampire Weekend](http://castlecast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=544452). The most recent episode was a panel discussion featuring John, [Crystal](http://twitter.com/starrfyre), [Larissa](http://twitter.com/piratescribe), [Nathaniel](http://twitter.com/nathanieletc), and myself. I had a great time on Castlecast and I hope to be on it again some time. Thanks John and Heidi!
