You have no idea how long Iâ€™ve been waiting for this feature. Currently Instagram appears to be testing it with select Android users, but I am unnaturally excited for the feature to arrive on iOS. I would happily sign-up for an opt-in beta if there was one. It would come in handy for switching between my [personal account](http://Instagram.com/FrankRamblings), my work account, and my [BostonPolaroid](http://instagram.com/bostonpolaroid) account.
