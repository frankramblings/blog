Just last year I got back into some of the vintage NES games from my childhood by setting up a Raspberry Pi as an emulator. [Nintendo’s NES Classic Edition](https://www.engadget.com/2016/07/14/nintendos-classic-mini-is-a-tiny-nes-with-30-games) seems to be aimed at people who are like me, except they don’t want to bother with the hassle of setting up a mini computer to do the job of a gaming console. At $60, you get the console, one controller, and 30 pre-loaded games. When you consider the price of even one modern video game, it seems pretty hard to beat!
