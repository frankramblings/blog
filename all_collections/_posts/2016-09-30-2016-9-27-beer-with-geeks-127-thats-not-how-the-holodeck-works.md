[This week on Beer With Geeks](http://www.beerwithgeeks.com/2016/09/127-thats-not-how-holodeck-works.html), Frank and Tim take a topic suggestion from listener [@StJohnOfPetra](https://twitter.com/stjohnofpetra/status/778637814808268800) and they cast their favorite superheroes as the crew of the Starship Enterprise. Who is the best captain? Who is the best red shirt? Listen and find out. Cheers!
