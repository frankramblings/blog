I saw this before Quantum of Solace a couple of weekends ago and I was totally blown away. While I’m still not down with the idea of the Enterprise being built in the 20th century instead of the 23rd, the awesomeness of this trailer is making it easier to forgive that. It’s a re-imagining of Star Trek. I’ve gotta say Zachary Quinto (Sylar from *Heroes*) really looks the part of Spock. Very much looking forward to this movie.
