[Introducing The Marketers Next Door!](http://www.marketersnextdoor.com/2016/08/001-gimme-that-low-cpl.html) My new podcast where my almost-wife Marissa and I talk about our careers in social media marketing. On this first episode live from our living room couch, we talk about Instagram Stories, Twitter Moments, and Facebookâ€™s war on clickbait.
