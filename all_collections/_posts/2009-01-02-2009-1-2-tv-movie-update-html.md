<div src="v5">So a while back I listed some TV shows and movies I planned to watch. I’m not making as much progress as I’d hoped, but here’s how it’s going so far: - <span style="font-style: italic;">Terminator</span> — <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">DONE</span>
- Terminator 2 — <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">DONE</span>
- Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles —<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> DONE</span>
- Firefly — <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IN PROGRESS</span>
- Serenity
- Supernatural
- Buffy the Vampire Slayer
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>

I watched <span style="font-style: italic;">T1, T2</span>, and the first several episodes of <span style="font-style: italic;">T:SCC</span> in a single day. I finished the whole series in just a few days. It was glorious. AMAZING show! Definitely the most underrated and best-written show on television. Not my favorite (that would be <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallville</span>), but it is the most well-written.

Then I got started on Firefly and hit a brick wall. I haven’t been able to watch more than 1 or 2 episodes in a sitting. Things seem to keep getting in the way. It’s an awesome show as well, and I can’t figure out how it got canceled other than the fact that FOX has an itchy trigger finger. I’m halfway through it now and I plan to finish it and watch <span style="font-style: italic;">Serenity,</span> the movie that accompanies it.

However, at the suggestions of several people, especially my friends Tim and Faith, I’ve added the CW’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Supernatual </span>to the list. The show is ending soon, so I’d like to get caught up before it goes off the air. Once I’m caught up, I’ll continue with <span style="font-style: italic;">Buffy</span> and eventually <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>. To be perfectly honest, I’m not really pumped for <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>, so depending how I feel about <span style="font-style: italic;">Buffy</span>, I may or may not go through with <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>. We shall see.
