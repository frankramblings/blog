So a while back I listed some TV shows and movies I planned to watch. I’m not making as much progress as I’d hoped, but here’s how it’s going so far: 
- *Terminator* — DONE
- *Terminator 2* — DONE
- *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles* — DONE
- *Firefly* — IN PROGRESS
- *Serenity*
- *Supernatural*
- *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*
- *Angel*

I watched *T1*, *T2*, and the first several episodes of *T:SCC* in a single day. I finished the whole series in just a few days. It was glorious. AMAZING show! Definitely the most underrated and best-written show on television. Not my favorite (that would be *Smallville*), but it is the most well-written.

Then I got started on *Firefly* and hit a brick wall. I haven’t been able to watch more than 1 or 2 episodes in a sitting. Things seem to keep getting in the way. It’s an awesome show as well, and I can’t figure out how it got canceled other than the fact that FOX has an itchy trigger finger. I’m halfway through it now and I plan to finish it and watch *Serenity*, the movie that accompanies it.

However, at the suggestions of several people, especially my friends Tim and Faith, I’ve added the CW’s *Supernatual* to the list. The show is ending soon, so I’d like to get caught up before it goes off the air. Once I’m caught up, I’ll continue with *Buffy* and eventually *Angel*. To be perfectly honest, I’m not really pumped for *Angel*, so depending how I feel about *Buffy*, I may or may not go through with *Angel*. We shall see.
