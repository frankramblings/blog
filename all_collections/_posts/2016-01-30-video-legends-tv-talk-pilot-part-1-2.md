As the legends of the DC universe have united to fight the forces of evil, so must the legends of DC TV podcasting unite to create ***Legends TV Talk***! Each week, a rotating panel of hosts from podcasts covering the best of DCâ€™s TV offerings will come together to recap and review *DCâ€™s Legends of Tomorrow*. I was lucky enough to be a member of the panel for episode 1 with [Flash TV Talk](http://www.flashtvtalk.com)â€˜s Beau York and [Arrow TV Talk](http://www.arrowtvtalk.com)â€˜s Justin Vactor. The show will be streamed live each week on Google Hangouts, and available afterwards on YouTube and as an audio podcast. Be sure to subscribe so you never miss an episode!
