For the last couple of months I’ve been working on improving my Geek Cred by catching up on the many TV shows &amp; films I missed out on when I was busy trying to pretend I had a life. When last we spoke, I was working my way through Joss Whedon’s *Firefly.* It continues to roll along smoothly: 

- *Terminator — DONE
- Terminator 2 — DONE
- Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles — DONE
- Firefly — DONE
- Serenity — DONE
- Buffy the Vampire Slayer — IN PROGRESS
- Angel
- Supernatural

I took a bit of a break after *Firefly/Serenity* and meant to start working on *Supernatural*, but as *Dollhouse*‘s premiere drew closer and Echo Alert was conceived, I decided it was essential that I complete my Whedon training before moving on to other shows. At the moment I’m finishing Buffy Season 5 Episode 15 “I Was Made To Love You.” This is really a great show and I can see why so many fans consider it a yardstick by which all other Joss media should be measured. I’ll talk more about when I’ve finished the series and have the proper perspective. I’m especially looking forward to the musical episode “Once More with Feeling”, the crossover episodes with *Angel*, and the Buffy Season 8 comics. But for now, the catchup continues.
