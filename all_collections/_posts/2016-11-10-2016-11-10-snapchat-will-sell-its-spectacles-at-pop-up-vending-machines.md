![A yellow vending machine in the middle of nowhere](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5070e334e4b00907bc18faef/1478790768272-LROUFSMPRBAYRWMZRUG9/IMG_3493.JPG)

Because Snap Inc. never does anything the conventional way. The machines will be called Snapbots and you can [check their online map](https://www.spectacles.com/map/) to see if there will be one near you.

> Each Snapbot vending machine will have motion sensors that turn on its circular screen when someone steps into view. The screen will show footage of video recordings from the eyewear, which can record 10-second clips that sync with the Snapchat app.
