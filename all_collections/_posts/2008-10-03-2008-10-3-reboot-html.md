<div src="v5">So this is either my third or fourth attempt at regularly maintaining a blog. It depends how you look at it. I tried twice in high school. Once in 2004 for a couple of days, and then again in 2006 for a few weeks. Then in 2006 I started a podcast and made a blog to serve as a website for that. I still maintain it at [frankpodcast.tk](http://www.frankpodcast.tk/), but I don’t feel that it’s appropriate to use it for my personal thoughts. A friend told me today that he was starting his own blog, and I was inspired to go back to my own blogging ways. Originally, I meant to continue where I left off with the old blog I started in ’04, but for some reason I couldn’t log in to it. I read through it, though. It’s amazing how much things have changed in just a couple of years. If you want to check that out, head on over to [mistaguitarmasta.blogspot.com](http://mistaguitarmasta.blogspot.com/) and take a walk down Memory Lane. My memories, that is.

So where do I go from here? Well, I don’t really know. I’ll be upfront and admit that the only reason I’m starting this up again is to keep myself entertained and to keep sort of a journal of the things that interest me, as well as the things that go on in my life. If I find an interesting news story, I’ll post it here. If I had a good sandwich, I’ll talk about it here. This is for me to write about whatever I feel like. I would greatly appreciate any comments you might have. So make use of the comment boxes. Even send an email to<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">frankramblings@gmail.com</span> if you like. Feedback is always appreciated. Let’s see how long I keep it up this time. A long time, hopefully.
