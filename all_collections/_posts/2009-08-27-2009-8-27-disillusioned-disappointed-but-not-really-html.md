This is going to seem stupid to many of you, but here goes anyway. When it comes to spelling and grammar, I have a pretty serious case of O.C.D. I’m not very forgiving of those errors, mostly because spelling and grammar come very naturally to me. I know if a sentence is grammatically correct or if a word is spelled properly just by reading or hearing it. It usually doesn’t take very much effort on my part. That’s why I was so surprised today when I read Green Lantern #45, written by the illustrious Geoff Johns, and ran across the following grammatical error from the mouth of Hal Jordan’s on-again, off-again love interest Carol Ferris:  

>	“Hal and I broke up more times then he’s charged his ring.”

Maybe some of you don’t even see the error, but to me, “then” stands out like a sore thumb. So what’s the point of all this? I mentioned it in passing during a conversation with my friend Faith, and the following dialogue came out of it. I thought it was funny, so upon her suggestion, I’m posting it here. (Forgive our grammatical laziness, specifically the lack of capitalization. This was just a private instant message conversation.)

**Me**: I saw a spelling/grammar error in a comic today

**Faith**: no way!

**Me**: yeah. my previously unwavering faith in geoff johns was shaken.

**Faith**: oh no!

**Me**: it’ll take some time but I think we can patch things up

**Faith**: so sad

**Faith**: I know you two will make it work out

**Faith**: you’re made for each other

**Me**: I hope you’re right

**Me**: things have been so great until now

**Me**: I don’t want it to end so suddenly

**Faith**: it’s the first stutter in your relationship, give it time, things will go back to normal

**Me**: just because he used “then” when he clearly meant “than”

**Faith**: oh, that’s not as bad as I thought

**Faith**: it’s just one bad issue. It’ll go back to normal next time

**Me**: that shouldn’t get past the proofreader!!

**Faith**: see, that’s not him

**Faith**: that’s an external force

**Me**: but he wrote it in the first place!

**Faith**: honey, you’re arguing semantics in a one time situation

**Faith**: everyone slips up a bit

**Me**: this is sounding too much like a real almost-break-up so I’m going to stop before I seriously frighten myself
