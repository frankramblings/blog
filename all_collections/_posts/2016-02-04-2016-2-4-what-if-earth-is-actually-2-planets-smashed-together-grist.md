An interesting theory recently published in the journal *Science* proposes that Earth may be the result of two colliding bodies that fused together early on. According to the theory, this impact created both the Earth and the Moon.

>	Astronomers have [long suspected](http://www.sciencealert.com/crash-a-ah-our-moon-has-a-history-of-violence) that the moon formed after a small, proto-planet, 
>	called Theia, crashed into Earth, knocking a chunk of rock into Earthâ€™s orbit. 
>	New research by scientists at the University of California Los Angeles suggests 
>	that Theia didnâ€™t merely sideswipe Earth, but instead fused with our planet, 
>	forming both modern Earth and the moon.
>	
>	The new evidence comes from an analysis of oxygen isotopes from both volcanic 
>	rocks and lunar rocks that were brought to Earth as part of the Apollo missions. 
>	The astronomers found that the isotopes share a unique fingerprint, 
>	something that could only happen if matter from Theia and Earth thoroughly mixed 
>	together in a head-on collision.
