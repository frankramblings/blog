Fraser Speirs did a brilliant job of satirizing the way tech journalists compare iPads to MacBooks in this blog post. I’ve got to admit he makes a pretty solid case for the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement.

“If you have certain very specifically-defined workflows, and a work environment where you can guarantee yourself a chair and desk, you can probably get your work done on a MacBook Pro. For the rest of the world, there’s iPad.”
