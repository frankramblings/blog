Instagram looks to be differentiating themselves from Snapchat a bit more. *Finally* being able to share URLs is a big one. I hope we can finally say goodbye to “Link in Bio!”

>	“Starting today the company will let creators add URL links to their stories that viewers can navigate >  to without leaving Instagram, add the ability for users to be “@ mentioned” in someone’s story, and add >  the ability to add a Boomerang to your story without having to go create one in the separate Boomerang >  app.”
