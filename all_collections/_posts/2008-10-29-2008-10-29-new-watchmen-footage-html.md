<div src="v5"><div>Oh this is awesome. Recently Spike TV’s 2008 Scream Awards featured a new trailer for 2009’s big screen adaptation of the most revered graphic novel of all time <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Watchmen</span>. Having read the book myself recently in preparation for the film’s release, I can vouch for its high levels of awesomeness. If you haven’t read it, do yourself a favor and pick it up. You can find it at any bookstore like Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble. “Absolute” and regular hardcover editions are due out in the next few weeks, so it might be worth the wait. For a quick synopsis of the film, check out the video’s description on the YouTube page.</div><div><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zRiuGRAU7WI&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zRiuGRAU7WI&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></embed></object></div>[
