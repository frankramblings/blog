According to [ZDNet](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/wp-trackback.php?p=1182) and other sources, including Felicia Day’s Twitter, Gmail began offering themes to a limited number of users (Felicia included, apparently) today. I am not yet one of those lucky users. I really hope they make it available for all users very soon, because I really want to try it out. I like the themes they have for iGoogle, so hopefully the Gmail themes will be equally cool. Here’s hoping.
