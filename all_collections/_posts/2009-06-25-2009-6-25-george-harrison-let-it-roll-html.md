<div src="v5"><div>I’m very surprised, but very glad to see a new George Harrison compilation album coming out soon. George’s solo music is among the most underrated material  
in all of popular music. Hopefully this will do well on iTunes and bring George’s music to prominence in the same way the Beatles’ “1” album did a few years back.</div><script src="http://widgets.clearspring.com/o/4a37cb0dc037c18b/4a43fdab65fe4e14/4a37e26dde7c5191/6b4d3a64/widget.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
