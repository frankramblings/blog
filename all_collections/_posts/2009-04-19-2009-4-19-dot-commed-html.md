<div src="v5">I’m happy to announce that frankramblings.tk is now frankramblings.com! This is actually my first .com domain and I’m <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> excited about it. I’ve been building websites ([of varying quality](http://geocities.com/mangoboy89/Yankees.html)) since about 1998 or 1999 and I always wanted a .com, but I could never afford it. But now thanks to [GoDaddy.com](http://godaddy.com), it’s really affordable and completely worth it. I even got a [promo code](http://revision3.com/godaddy) to make it amazingly inexpensive. So the .tk domain will still redirect here, but let’s face it, .com is just cooler! I expect to be making some changes around here and start updating more often, so stay tuned.</div>
