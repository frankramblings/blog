We all know Adele is ridiculously talented, and this confirms it. The raw feed of her SNL vocal performance (with a few cut-ins from the drums and bass) is perfect. Her vocal technique is unmatched by anyone else in our generation. Just listen to her switch effortlessly from chest tone to head tone and back. Sheâ€™s one of the most talented performers of our generation and Iâ€™m very much looking forward to giving *25* several more listens.
