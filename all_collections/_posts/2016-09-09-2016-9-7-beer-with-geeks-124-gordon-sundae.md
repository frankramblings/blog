[On this week’s Beer With Geeks](http://www.beerwithgeeks.com/2016/09/124-gordon-sundae.html): *Batman: The Animated Series* celebrates the 24th anniversary of its triumphant TV debut. Tim and Frank review the first episode “On Leather Wings” and reminisce about the series overall. Also, Tim’s childhood action figure collection makes an appearance. Cheers!
