[Not a huge surprise to see Google striking here.](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/08/meet-google-duo-simple-1-to-1-video.html) Think of trying to Skype your mom when she has Android and you use iOS. This reduces the complexity and delivers what Apple promised FaceTime would do as far back as 2010 but never brought us: simple, cross-platform video chat.
