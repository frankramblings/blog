If you haven’t seen this yet, your life is officially incomplete. Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog is a short web musical film that was written, produced &amp; directed by Joss Whedon &amp; his brothers Zack &amp; Jed, as well as Jed’s Fiancé Maurissa Tancharoen. It was a product of the Writers Guild of America strike that nearly brought TV and movie production to a stand-still from late 2007 through early 2008. It is a hilarious and delightful piece of work that everyone needs to see. Please check it out! It’s short and free! (TWSS)
