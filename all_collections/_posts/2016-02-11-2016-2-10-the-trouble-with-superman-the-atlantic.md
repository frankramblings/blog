This piece in *The Atlantic* does a good job of summarizing the way I feel about the way DC Comics has been handling Superman over the last several years. There are some things I donâ€™t agree with here, but I think the overall message is pretty on point: they very obviously donâ€™t know what to do with the character. The more they try reinventing him, the more disservice they do him.

>	Behold! I give you the problem of Superman. Itâ€™s a problem that has 
>	less to do with the character himself and more to with DC Comics, 
>	which found itself stuck with a flagship character it thought needed 
>	fixing. In trying, it broke him nearly beyond repair.
