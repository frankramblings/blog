I am currently working my way through Arroyo’s first NYT Best Seller, the aptly-titled *Mother Angelica*, the biography of the foundress of the world’s largest Catholic Radio &amp; TV Network, [EWTN](http://www.ewtn.com/). It is an inspiring and true story of faith and strength in the face of so many challenges and sufferings. Arroyo brings Mother Angelica’s life story to the reader in such plain and simple, yet moving language, yet he does not hesitate to point out failings and shortcomings. His writing is realistic and inspirational.
