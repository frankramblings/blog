One of the most time-honored traditions of social media is the live-tweeting of live events by viewers. Who doesn’t love a little snark to go with their entertainment? This year’s Academy Awards drew some masterful tweets from names both big and small. Let’s take a look at some of the most brilliant uses of Twitter to supplement this year’s Oscars!

# The Muppets

She’s the original diva. America’s sweetheart. The princess of pork. She’s Miss Piggy. And her attitude was out – in full force – last Sunday! Who needs Joan and Melissa Rivers? Miss Piggy has enough sass for all of us! Given the recent resurgence of the Muppets’ popularity and the fact that *The Muppets* was nominated for and won an Oscar, it makes all the sense in the world that Piggy would take hold of the Twitterverse. And take hold, she did!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oscars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Oscars</a> time! Moi is ready for moi’s close-up!</p>&mdash; The Muppets (@TheMuppets) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMuppets/status/173942130002247680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2012</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Just another reason America loves Miss Piggy!

# Angelina’s Right Leg

Whether you love her, hate her, or want her to adopt you, you can’t deny that Angelina’s dress was eye-catching! Leave it to Twitter to turn Angie’s leg into a meme. All it took was 22 tweets for this account to explode from 0 to over 32,000 followers in a matter of hours. What does this show us? The power of the Retweet. By taking full advantage of a trending hashtag and earning thousands of Retweets for timely and humorous content, this account launched itself from nonexistence to fame during the course of the broadcast. Imagine if this had been done by a brand!

> I’m a leg, get a load of me!!
