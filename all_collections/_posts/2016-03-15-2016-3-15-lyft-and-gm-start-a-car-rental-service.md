Really interesting new developments from the Lyft / GM partnership. It may not work for the average driver, but itâ€™s definitely a new direction for ride sharing.

> The rental program is a partnership between Lyft and GM, which has invested $500 million in Lyft. GM will maintain a fleet of Chevy Equinoxes in the Chicago area for the rental program, while both companies will cover the cost of insurance together. Lyft drivers will be be able to rent a vehicle based on a three-tiered pricing structure based on how many rides they complete each week.
