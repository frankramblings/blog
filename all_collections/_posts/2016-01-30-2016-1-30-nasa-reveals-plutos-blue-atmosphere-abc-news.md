The New Horizons probe continues send home images as part of NASAâ€™s year-long campaign to keep deep space exploration top of mind. This time, theyâ€™re showing us another never-before-seen view of Pluto.

> NASA said the blue ring around Pluto is created by sunlight scattering from haze particles in the atmosphere. The haze is believed to be a photochemical smog created by sunlight hitting methane and other particles on the dwarf planet.
