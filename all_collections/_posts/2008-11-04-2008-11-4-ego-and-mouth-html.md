> After the big gamble on subprime mortgages 
> that led to the current financial crisis, is there 
> going to be an even bigger gamble, by putting 
> the fate of a nation in the hands of a man whose 
> only qualifications are ego and mouth?
> 
> Barack Obama has the kind of cocksure confidence 
> that can only be achieved by not achieving anything else.
> 
> Anyone who has actually had to take responsibility for 
> consequences by running any kind of enterprise — 
> whether economic or academic, or even just managing 
> a sports team — is likely at some point to be chastened 
> by either the setbacks brought on by his own mistakes 
> or by seeing his successes followed by negative 
> consequences that he never anticipated.
> 
> The kind of self-righteous self-confidence that has 
> become Obama’s trademark is usually found in sophomores 
> in Ivy League colleges — very bright and articulate students,
>  utterly untempered by experience in real world.
> 
> The signs of Barack Obama’s self-centered immaturity 
> are painfully obvious, though ignored by true believers 
> who have poured their hopes into him, and by the media 
> who just want the symbolism and the ideology that 
> Obama represents.
> 
> The triumphal tour of world capitals and photo-op 
> meetings with world leaders by someone who, after all, 
> was still merely a candidate, is just one sign of this 
> self-centered immaturity.
> 
> “This is our time!” he proclaimed. And “I will change 
> the world.” But ultimately this election is not about him, 
> but about the fate of this nation, at a time of both domestic 
> and international peril, with a major financial crisis still 
> unresolved and a nuclear Iran looming on the horizon.
> 
> For someone who has actually accomplished nothing to 
> blithely talk about taking away what has been earned by 
> those who have accomplished something, and give it to 
> whomever he chooses in the name of “spreading the wealth,” 
> is the kind of casual arrogance that has led to many economic 
> catastrophes in many countries.
> 
> The equally casual ease with which Barack Obama has talked 
> about appointing judges on the basis of their empathies with 
> various segments of the population makes a mockery of the 
> very concept of law.
> 
> After this man has wrecked the economy and destroyed 
> constitutional law with his judicial appointments, what can 
> he do for an encore? He can cripple the military and gamble 
> America’s future on his ability to sit down with enemy nations 
> and talk them out of causing trouble.
> 
> Senator Obama’s running mate, Senator Joe Biden, has for 
> years shown the same easy-way-out mindset. Senator Biden 
> has for decades opposed strengthening our military forces. 
> In 1991, Biden urged relying on sanctions to get Saddam Hussein’s 
> troops out of Kuwait, instead of military force, despite the 
> demonstrated futility of sanctions as a means of undoing an invasion.
> 
> People who think Governor Sarah Palin didn’t handle some 
> “gotcha” questions well in a couple of interviews show no 
> interest in how she compares to the Democrats’ Vice Presidential 
> candidate, Senator Biden.
> 
> Joe Biden is much more of the kind of politician the mainstream 
> media like. Not only is he a liberal’s liberal, he answers questions 
> far more glibly than Governor Palin — grossly inaccurately in 
> many cases, but glibly.
> 
> Moreover, this is a long-standing pattern with Biden. When he 
> was running for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination 
> back in 1987, someone in the audience asked him what law 
> school he attended and how well he did.
> 
> Flashing his special phony smile, Biden said, “I think I have a 
> much higher IQ than you do.” He added, “I went to law school 
> on a full academic scholarship” and “ended up in the top half” 
> of the class.
> 
> But Biden did not have a full academic scholarship. Newsweek 
> reported: “He went on a half scholarship based on need. He 
> didn’t finish in the ‘top half’ of his class. He was 76th out of 85.”
>  
> Add to Obama and Biden House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and 
> Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and you have all the 
> ingredients for a historic meltdown. Let us not forget that the 
> Roman Empire did decline and fall, blighting the lives of 
> millions for centuries.
