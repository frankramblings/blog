Lately I’ve been checking out Digg.com a lot. Pretty much daily. Lately it’s been Obama-central, but hopefully that will slow down after next week. It’s usually a great place for interesting and funny news. If you like bizarre but true stories, have a look. Here’s a prime example:

[The Muppet’s Animal Caught Speeding, Driving Police Crazy](http://gizmodo.com/5069422/the-muppets-animal-caught-speeding-driving-police-crazy)

See? Hilarious and true! Stuff like this pops up constantly on Digg. Then there’s also interesting pop culture stuff:
"[It’s official: Robert Downey Jr. will suit up for ‘The Avengers,’ Jon Favreau on board as an executive producer](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/its-official-ro.html)
That particular story makes me very happy, by the way. I loved *Iron Man* And I’m not a fan of the character, nor Marvel Comics in general. I’m looking forward to this *Avengers* movie. I know pretty much nothing about The Avengers, and in a way I want to keep it that way so I can enjoy the version of the story they decide to give us in the film. Anyway, check out Digg. They’re rather awesome. Incidentally, they have a podcast, *DiggNation*, which I’ll be reviewing soon as the next installment of my “Podcastin'” series.
