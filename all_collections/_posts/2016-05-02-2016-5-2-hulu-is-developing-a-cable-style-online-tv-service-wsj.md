If this is essentially SlingTV without all the downsides, it could be very compelling. More than anything, though, I would love to see one of these services allow users to authenticate online and access each network‚Äôs individual web video and set-top box video offerings. If I could log into FX and HBO and HGTV to access their apps through my Hulu account the way many people do with their Xfinity accounts, for example, I‚Äôd be perfectly content.
