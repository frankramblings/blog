Santa is bringing the world a long-awaited gift this Christmas Eve. The full Beatles catalogue will finally be available on pretty much every streaming service that’s worth mentioning. Sure, they’re late to the streaming party, but that’s really nothing new. You couldn’t buy Beatles tracks on iTunes until 2010. And sure, I own multiple copies of every Beatles album, including the Apple Lossless copies that have a permanent home on my iPhone. But knowing that the band that changed the world is finally available to anyone with a subscription to the most popular streaming sites just feels right to me. All Together Now!

Here’s what Ringo had to say about the announcement:
