        <div class="article-content"><p>Here we go again. Apple‚Äôs moves over the last few years seem to be pointing to the seemingly-inevitable convergence of iOS and Mac OS X. And yet here‚Äôs Tim Cook giving us the reasons why that wouldn‚Äôt work. Now, in the Steve Jobs era, you could almost count on Steve to criticize a product idea that Apple was actively developing. Video iPods and tablets were ridiculed by Steve prior to Apple launching them. Is Tim engaging in a diversionary tactic? It‚Äôs fair to say that Tim has proven himself to be a different kind of leader than Steve was, but this statement is ringing those particular bells for me. Could this denial be a sign that the iOS/Mac OS merger really will happen some day? Perhaps Mac OS 11 will finally launch around the same time that iOS 11 debuts, forming Apple OS. Who knows?</p>

<figure>&gt; data-animation-override&gt;  
&gt; <span>‚Äú</span>We feel strongly that customers are not really looking for a converged Mac and iPad \[‚Ä¶\] we want to make the best tablet in the world and the best Mac in the world. And putting those two together would not achieve either. You‚Äôd begin to compromise in different ways.<span>‚Äù</span>
