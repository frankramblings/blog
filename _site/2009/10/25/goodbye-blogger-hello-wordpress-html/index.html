        <div class="article-content"><p>I’ve been meaning to revamp the site for some time now, and I’ve also been meaning to switch from Blogger to WordPress. WordPress is much more powerful and versatile and allows for much greater customization. It just makes my life easier. I think I’ve picked out a pretty cool theme, though I’m not entirely satisfied with some of the smaller things. I’ll be tweaking things over the next few days. I also want to give a shoutout to my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/franktisellano">Frank</a> for hooking me up with hosting for the new site. I really love WordPress. The user interface is clean and simple, but it’s very powerful. A whole host of Plugins and Widgets make almost anything possible on this platform. I’ve always loved being able to customize things to my personal tastes and preferences, and WordPress makes it possible to do just that. There are limitless possibilities. If you’re new to blogging and just want a simple place to collect your thoughts, <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> provides a hosted solution. That means you don’t need to worry about where to keep your site; it exists on WordPress’s servers. You also don’t need to worry about keeping your version of WordPress up to date. They take care of that for you. However, it also means you have less control over themes and such. But again, it’s a great solution for less experienced users.</p>

<p>What I’m using now, though, is <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a>. There is a difference between the .com and .org versions. The .org version requires that you download the WordPress software and install it on a server of your own choosing. This means more work for you, but experienced users won’t have a problem with that. The benefits make it worth the legwork. You’ll find that the interface is more complex and capable of more. For one thing, you have complete control over the look of your site, down to every last line of HTML. Blogger allowed me to do this to a certain degree, but I’m now at the point where I’ve outgrown Blogger’s basic capabilities and I’m ready to tackle WordPress’s more mature way of doing things. So far I’m loving it. Really looking forward to playing around with this and learning how to un-tap its full potential.</p>
