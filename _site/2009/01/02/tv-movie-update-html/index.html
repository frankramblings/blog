        <div class="article-content"><p>So a while back I listed some TV shows and movies I planned to watch. I’m not making as much progress as I’d hoped, but here’s how it’s going so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Terminator</em> — DONE</li>
  <li><em>Terminator 2</em> — DONE</li>
  <li><em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em> — DONE</li>
  <li><em>Firefly</em> — IN PROGRESS</li>
  <li><em>Serenity</em></li>
  <li><em>Supernatural</em></li>
  <li><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></li>
  <li><em>Angel</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I watched <em>T1</em>, <em>T2</em>, and the first several episodes of <em>T:SCC</em> in a single day. I finished the whole series in just a few days. It was glorious. AMAZING show! Definitely the most underrated and best-written show on television. Not my favorite (that would be <em>Smallville</em>), but it is the most well-written.</p>

<p>Then I got started on <em>Firefly</em> and hit a brick wall. I haven’t been able to watch more than 1 or 2 episodes in a sitting. Things seem to keep getting in the way. It’s an awesome show as well, and I can’t figure out how it got canceled other than the fact that FOX has an itchy trigger finger. I’m halfway through it now and I plan to finish it and watch <em>Serenity</em>, the movie that accompanies it.</p>

<p>However, at the suggestions of several people, especially my friends Tim and Faith, I’ve added the CW’s <em>Supernatual</em> to the list. The show is ending soon, so I’d like to get caught up before it goes off the air. Once I’m caught up, I’ll continue with <em>Buffy</em> and eventually <em>Angel</em>. To be perfectly honest, I’m not really pumped for <em>Angel</em>, so depending how I feel about <em>Buffy</em>, I may or may not go through with <em>Angel</em>. We shall see.</p>
