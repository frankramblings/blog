        <div class="article-content"><p>This is going to seem stupid to many of you, but here goes anyway. When it comes to spelling and grammar, I have a pretty serious case of O.C.D. I’m not very forgiving of those errors, mostly because spelling and grammar come very naturally to me. I know if a sentence is grammatically correct or if a word is spelled properly just by reading or hearing it. It usually doesn’t take very much effort on my part. That’s why I was so surprised today when I read Green Lantern #45, written by the illustrious Geoff Johns, and ran across the following grammatical error from the mouth of Hal Jordan’s on-again, off-again love interest Carol Ferris:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>“Hal and I broke up more times then he’s charged his ring.”
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe some of you don’t even see the error, but to me, “then” stands out like a sore thumb. So what’s the point of all this? I mentioned it in passing during a conversation with my friend Faith, and the following dialogue came out of it. I thought it was funny, so upon her suggestion, I’m posting it here. (Forgive our grammatical laziness, specifically the lack of capitalization. This was just a private instant message conversation.)</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I saw a spelling/grammar error in a comic today</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: no way!</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: yeah. my previously unwavering faith in geoff johns was shaken.</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: oh no!</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: it’ll take some time but I think we can patch things up</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: so sad</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: I know you two will make it work out</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: you’re made for each other</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I hope you’re right</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: things have been so great until now</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I don’t want it to end so suddenly</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: it’s the first stutter in your relationship, give it time, things will go back to normal</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: just because he used “then” when he clearly meant “than”</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: oh, that’s not as bad as I thought</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: it’s just one bad issue. It’ll go back to normal next time</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: that shouldn’t get past the proofreader!!</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: see, that’s not him</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: that’s an external force</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: but he wrote it in the first place!</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: honey, you’re arguing semantics in a one time situation</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: everyone slips up a bit</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: this is sounding too much like a real almost-break-up so I’m going to stop before I seriously frighten myself</p>
