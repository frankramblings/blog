I had a pretty rotten day yesterday. I got home from school, plopped down on the couch, and pulled up the [<span style="font-style: italic;">Amadeus</span>](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/) film soundtrack in iTunes. I needed to unwind and so I turned to my favorite composer, Mozart, for comfort. From the opening strains of his [Symphony No. 25 in G Minor](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=4&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7lC1lRz5Z_s&amp;ei=oqXLSf21G9TVlQfyuYzWCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaRH8StnDaRgnPR6vQZLxgx1jFgQ&amp;sig2=XhHJ9veiu8yXDMsgL6uDUQ) ([K. 183](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Ritter_von_K%C3%B6chel#K.C3.B6chel_catalogue) for those of you who are curious), I really began to feel the day’s tension begin to dissipate. That particular piece has always had a powerful calming effect on me. There is a sad beauty in Mozart’s works that really speaks to me. I’ve heard the argument that his compositions are too mechanical and methodical in nature. I couldn’t disagree more. I submit his Requiem (K. 626) as an example. Especially the [Introitus](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dmb3bwGb0glQ&amp;ei=86XLSfbXEtHqlQe96f3fCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5-Udn5moufJe3GPz9xNh5SiuJ4w&amp;sig2=OjIkKq7Uc38PYc8mcJ30UQ) and the [Confutatis](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtXXHYX7zk1c&amp;ei=OKbLSYm9IqPrlQfZ1czfCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZ6Umyghoae2jML-EV9dzaYDpd2w&amp;sig2=Nz17uez1ySRdB779ueUMGQ). Just gorgeous, gripping music. I discovered about 10 years ago that somehow, sad music makes me happy. Maybe I just appreciate the work of a good composer. Maybe just the realization that music is eliciting an emotion in me – even if that emotion is sadness – amazes me so much that I can’t help but smile. Whatever it is, it’s real. And it doesn’t just apply to Mozart. [Albinoni’s Adagio in G Minor](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dmz4dpbk8YBs&amp;ei=V6XLSYn3CqPslQeBpdnMCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSJgh21I0sFjHr0W-hD9MatbThpg&amp;sig2=92_osNIwa-MX6fDeX2kSkg) has the same calming effect on me. It’s just amazing that music can be so powerful. I’ll never get over the feeling of wonder that comes with a Mozart symphony.
