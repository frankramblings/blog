        <div class="article-content"><p>Life has been busier than ever, but somehow I’ve managed to emerge from my cave and do a bit of guest blogging this week. I had forgotten just how much I love it and it was a refreshing change of pace from my recent activities. First, I wrote up a piece for the <a href="http://www.likeable.com/2011/02/update-overload-stay-afloat-in-a-facebook-flood/">Likeable Media</a> blog. <em><a href="http://www.likeable.com/2011/02/update-overload-stay-afloat-in-a-facebook-flood/">My post</a></em> is a guide to avoiding annoying trends and events in your social media stream without having to give up your addiction all together. It was first inspired by my annoyance with Super Bowl tweets, but it really applies to any event that you don’t want to have polluting your timeline. <em>Please do me a *huge</em> favor and hit the “Tweet” button when you read it!*</p>

<p>Next, I wrote a post for my good friends at <a href="geeksofdoom.com/2011/02/07/the-beatles-invaded-america-47-years-ago-today/">GeeksOfDoom.com</a>. Yesterday was the 47th anniversary of The Beatles’ arrival in the US, so I contributed a piece that put into perspective the impact that their arrival had on music and on history in general. It’s just a brief look into my feelings on the subject, but it’s something I feel really passionate about, and I’m proud of how it turned out.</p>

<p>I’m going to try to use this unexpected burst of self-expression and turn it into something productive. I really miss blogging, but I’m so busy doing things these days, I rarely have the time to sit down and make a verbal record of them. Still, I really love the rewarding nature of blogging, and I miss writing for fun. I’m not going to be that guy who apologizes for not updating his blog often enough, promises to blog every day, and then disappears for another six months, but I am going to at least try and make a habit of keeping this site at least somewhat up to date. I’ve felt uninspired for several months, but lately, some ideas have been brewing, and I’d love a chance to put them into words and get them out there. So here’s to blogging!</p>
