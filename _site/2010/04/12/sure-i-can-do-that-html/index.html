        <div class="article-content"><div src="v5">I say it to myself all the time. Each time, I know that the more I say it, the deeper I dig myself. And yet I keep going. I’m just not busy enough, apparently. Well, in the last couple of months I’ve been saying, “Sure, I can do that,” a lot more than ever before. As busy as that makes me, I’ve found that I actually enjoy diving head-first into a project and just giving it everything I’ve got. My most recent projects are two new podcasts. I know. Shocking. Since December, I’ve been working with some friends on starting a network of audio dramas based on our favorite comic books. We call ourselves **[Thought Bubble Audio](http://thoughtbubbleaudio.com)**. Our debut project is a Superman/Batman tale based on the origins of Supergirl [as told by Jeph Loeb and Michael Turner](http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Batman-Vol-2-Supergirl/dp/1401202500/ref=tmm_pap_title_0). It’s an awesome story and adapting it for audio has been a challenging but incredibly fun process. I’ve been blogging about it on our site, tracking our progress, and it continues to blow my mind that we’re actually doing something. Pre-production is just about wrapped up now and we’re beginning the daunting process of actually recording and producing what we hope will be an exciting and fun show. Check out the [site](http://thoughtbubbleaudio.com) and [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/TBA_Studios) for updates and news about when we’ll be ready for release!

Another project I’ve been working on for the last several weeks is something I’ve been thinking about for quite some time: a tech podcast. My good friend [Justin Vactor](http://twitter.com/vactor) of the [Geekland](http://geeklandpodcast.com), [Entertainment Overload](http://fusedfilm.com/tag/entertainment-overload-podcast/), and [Gotham Central](http://gothampodcast.com) podcasts joined forces with me to create [**Tech Ramblings**](http://tech-ramblings.com): a show where we talk tech with our own fun spin. Justin and I have known each other for over a year now, and I’ve always considered him a very knowledgeable and capable podcaster. He produces *very* high quality shows, and it’s been a pleasure to work with him. We just have a great time talking 3 tech news issues each week, often giving our own opinions on what’s going on. It’s a rapid-fire snapshot of what’s going on in the tech industry from week to week. I look forward to recording with Justin every week and I hope you’ll look forward to hearing what we have to say!

On top of these new shows, I’m actually working on developing as many as 3 more, if everything works out. If everything comes together to make these shows happen, I’ll be podcasting with some very cool friends who I’ve been looking forward to working with for a while now. Things are about to get crazy over here and I’m dying to get into it all. I’ll be trying out some new things I’ve never done before. Sure, my life as a student, intern, and employee already keep me busy, but these projects make it all seem worth it. They keep me sane and give me something to look forward to. So here’s to more podcasting!
