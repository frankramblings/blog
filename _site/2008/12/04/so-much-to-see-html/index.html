        <div class="article-content"><div src="v5">With the fall semester drawing to a close and the only two shows I watch regularly (Smallville and Heroes) going on hiatus, I’m going to be missing my regularly-scheduled entertainment fix over the Christmas break. I’ve been hearing a lot about Joss Whedon’s ill-fated <span style="font-style: italic;">Firefly</span> series and its acompanying film <span style="font-style: italic;">Serenity.</span> Friends have told me I need to see it, but I lacked the interest and – more importantly – the time required to watch it. That’s where the internet steps in. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog</span> formally introduced me to the mind of Joss Whedon. After enjoying that as much as I did I decided I’d add <span style="font-style: italic;">Firefly</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Serenity</span> to my mental “To Be Watched” list. Then Aaron and Will over at the [Axed](http://www.axedpodcast.com/) podcast did an entire episode on <span style="font-style: italic;">Firefly/Serenity</span> this week. Also, as most of you know, I’ve been addicted to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) for over a month now. It’s an amazing site that you need to check out if you haven’t already. I’ve been talking to lots of very cool people there. Late last week, I started talking to the hosts of the [Chic Geek Podcast](http://chicgeekpodcast.blogspot.com/). I listened to all of their episodes in a matter of three days and enjoyed them immensely. Faith and Ky are really funny and made me genuinely interested in checking out a few things I’ve been holding off on. I think I’m going to do a full review of their show as part of my all-but-abandoned “Podcastin’ ” ongoing blog post series, so be on the lookout for that. Aside from giving me the final push towards watching <span style="font-style: italic;">Firefly/Serenity</span>, the Chic Geek girls have convinced me to look into <span style="font-style: italic;">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span>, its popular spin-off <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</span> (T:SCC), which is supposed to be the best show on television right now, according to Faith, as well as Steve and Derek of [SHoE](http://smallvillepodcast.com/) (who also run a Sarah Connor Chronicles podcast called [SkyNext](http://www.skynextpodcast.com/)). So I’ll be keeping quite busy over this break. Of course I hope to be working; in fact I need to remember to call my place of summer employ tomorrow to make sure they still need me over Christmas. However, if that goes through, I usually work early in the day, from 7am-3pm. That leaves plenty of time each day for catching up on good TV. Of course to watch T:SCC, I need to see the Terminator films, which I’m ashamed to say I’ve never seen. I know. Go on, ostracize me. But before you do, know that I watched <span style="font-style: italic;">The Terminator</span> mere moments before writing this post and LOVED it. I’m going to get started on <span style="font-style: italic;">Terminator 2</span> in<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span> just a few minutes. <span style="font-style: italic;">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</span> isn’t directly related to T:SCC, so I’ll probably put off watching that until after I’m all caught up with everything else. I’ve only got a month of freedom to watch 7+ years’ worth of TV and movies, so I don’t want to waste my time.

Here’s the order in which I plan to watch all this stuff. If you have any suggestions for how I might amend it, feel free to comment.

- <span style="font-style: italic;">Terminator</span> — <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">DONE</span>
- Terminator 2 — <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">DONE</span>
- Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles —<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">SEASON 1 DONE, S2 IN PROGRESS</span>
- Firefly
- Serenity
- Buffy the Vampire Slayer
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>

NOTE: Edited to reflect the completion of items on the To-Watch list.
