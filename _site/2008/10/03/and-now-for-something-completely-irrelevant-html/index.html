        <div class="article-content"><div src="v5">So as I sit here with my friend Tom, we discover just how bored we are. I’m blogging for the first time in almost two years, and he’s taking a survey on Myspace. That’s right. <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Myspace.</span></span> These truly are troubled times. Now Steve has joined us. He’s eating pizza. We’re helping Tom make this most ridiculous Myspace survey ever. Sounds fun, right? Yeah. College is just that good. Especially when you’re a commuter with a couple of free hours on your hands. Next up, at 2:00 I’m going to the writing center. I’ve started working there. Well…”working” is a little misleading. I’ve been training to be a writing tutor. This entails observing tutoring sessions 5 hours a week. This is the end of my second week. I think I’m ready to actually take on some sessions of my own. I think I’m going to talk to my boss about that today. Observation is becoming a little tedious. I feel like I’m ready to step up.

Next week is the start of midterms. My Ethics midterm is spread out over Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I’m not really looking forward to that. Luckily, the professor gave us a list of topics we should study. So that means that I’ll probably spend most of Saturday and a couple of weeknights writing up model essay outlines for each topic. What fun.

As for other midterms, I think they’re the week after next. I haven’t really heard anything from any professors about dates, times or rooms yet. And they aren’t listed on the St. John’s website yet, so I guess I’m still safe.

Tonight the new Clone Wars series premieres on Cartoon Network. Also, the popular web cartoon [Making Fiends](http://makingfiends.com) is making the jump to NickToon this weekend. I’m looking forward to seeing both of those show, but due to extenuating circumstances, I won’t be able to view them as they air. This is a bit disappointing as a long-time fan of both Star Wars and Making Fiends, but hopefully the magic of the internet will avail me the opportunity to download them (through nefarious means) and watch them shortly after they air. Here’s hoping.
