NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) – Wall Street hardly 
delivered arousing welcome to President-elect 
Barack Obama on Wednesday,dropping by the largest 
margin on record for a day following a U.S.
presidential contest. The slide more than wiped out 
the previous day’s advance, the largest Election Day 
rally ever for U.S. stocks. The following table shows 
the percentage rise or decline in the Dow Jones 
industrial average (.DJI), Standard &amp; Poor’s 
500 index (.SPX) and Nasdaq composite index (.IXIC) 
on the day after a U.S presidential election and who 
won the Election Day vote.

<p>Interesting, isn’t it? Incidentally, last Saturday, CNBC’s Larry Kudlow predicted a 1000-point Dow rally the day after a McCain victory. While this prediction doesn’t necessarily mean that’s what would have happened, it is interesting to note that upon the election of the candidate who promised economic stability and prosperity, the market took a historic turn for the worse. What does Wall Street know that we don’t know? Hmm? Or maybe we <em>do</em> know, but were so mesmerized by a man who never says anything that we voted foolishly. Yeah, maybe that’s it.</p>
