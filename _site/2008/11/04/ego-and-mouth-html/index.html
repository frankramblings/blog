<p>By Thomas Sowell</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the big gamble on subprime mortgages 
that led to the current financial crisis, is there 
going to be an even bigger gamble, by putting 
the fate of a nation in the hands of a man whose 
only qualifications are ego and mouth?</p>

  <p>Barack Obama has the kind of cocksure confidence 
that can only be achieved by not achieving anything else.</p>

  <p>Anyone who has actually had to take responsibility for 
consequences by running any kind of enterprise — 
whether economic or academic, or even just managing 
a sports team — is likely at some point to be chastened 
by either the setbacks brought on by his own mistakes 
or by seeing his successes followed by negative 
consequences that he never anticipated.</p>

  <p>The kind of self-righteous self-confidence that has 
become Obama’s trademark is usually found in sophomores 
in Ivy League colleges — very bright and articulate students,
 utterly untempered by experience in real world.</p>

  <p>The signs of Barack Obama’s self-centered immaturity 
are painfully obvious, though ignored by true believers 
who have poured their hopes into him, and by the media 
who just want the symbolism and the ideology that 
Obama represents.</p>

  <p>The triumphal tour of world capitals and photo-op 
meetings with world leaders by someone who, after all, 
was still merely a candidate, is just one sign of this 
self-centered immaturity.</p>

  <p>“This is our time!” he proclaimed. And “I will change 
the world.” But ultimately this election is not about him, 
but about the fate of this nation, at a time of both domestic 
and international peril, with a major financial crisis still 
unresolved and a nuclear Iran looming on the horizon.</p>

  <p>For someone who has actually accomplished nothing to 
blithely talk about taking away what has been earned by 
those who have accomplished something, and give it to 
whomever he chooses in the name of “spreading the wealth,” 
is the kind of casual arrogance that has led to many economic 
catastrophes in many countries.</p>

  <p>The equally casual ease with which Barack Obama has talked 
about appointing judges on the basis of their empathies with 
various segments of the population makes a mockery of the 
very concept of law.</p>

  <p>After this man has wrecked the economy and destroyed 
constitutional law with his judicial appointments, what can 
he do for an encore? He can cripple the military and gamble 
America’s future on his ability to sit down with enemy nations 
and talk them out of causing trouble.</p>

  <p>Senator Obama’s running mate, Senator Joe Biden, has for 
years shown the same easy-way-out mindset. Senator Biden 
has for decades opposed strengthening our military forces. 
In 1991, Biden urged relying on sanctions to get Saddam Hussein’s 
troops out of Kuwait, instead of military force, despite the 
demonstrated futility of sanctions as a means of undoing an invasion.</p>

  <p>People who think Governor Sarah Palin didn’t handle some 
“gotcha” questions well in a couple of interviews show no 
interest in how she compares to the Democrats’ Vice Presidential 
candidate, Senator Biden.</p>

  <p>Joe Biden is much more of the kind of politician the mainstream 
media like. Not only is he a liberal’s liberal, he answers questions 
far more glibly than Governor Palin — grossly inaccurately in 
many cases, but glibly.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this is a long-standing pattern with Biden. When he 
was running for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination 
back in 1987, someone in the audience asked him what law 
school he attended and how well he did.</p>

  <p>Flashing his special phony smile, Biden said, “I think I have a 
much higher IQ than you do.” He added, “I went to law school 
on a full academic scholarship” and “ended up in the top half” 
of the class.</p>

  <p>But Biden did not have a full academic scholarship. Newsweek 
reported: “He went on a half scholarship based on need. He 
didn’t finish in the ‘top half’ of his class. He was 76th out of 85.”</p>

  <p>Add to Obama and Biden House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and you have all the 
ingredients for a historic meltdown. Let us not forget that the 
Roman Empire did decline and fall, blighting the lives of 
millions for centuries.</p>
