        <div class="article-content"><p>If this is essentially SlingTV without all the downsides, it could be very compelling. More than anything, though, I would love to see one of these services allow users to authenticate online and access each network‚Äôs individual web video and set-top box video offerings. If I could log into FX and HBO and HGTV to access their apps through my Hulu account the way many people do with their Xfinity accounts, for example, I‚Äôd be perfectly content.</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>‚ÄúHulu hasn‚Äôt set a price for its planned service but 
Sanford C. Bernstein media analyst Todd Juenger estimated 
that it would likely cost around $40 a month. An executive 
close to Hulu said that figure was in the ballpark. 
The service will likely also offer a cloud-based 
digital video recorder and a way for viewers to watch past 
episodes of shows on-demand, as they can do on many cable 
and satellite TV services. Hulu is planning on having targeted 
advertising in its service, according to the people familiar.‚Äù
