<p>This is a huge shift. And potentially a sign of re-shuffled priorities at Twitter. Earlier this week, despite a positive earnings report, they also announced a layoff of 9% of their staff. Their rumored struggle to sell company is most definitely a motivating factor here. Maybe they’ll be investing more in live video via Periscope and their partnerships with organizations like the NFL? We’ll see soon.</p>

<p>Expect to hear more about this on an upcoming episode of <a href="http://marketersnextdoor.com">The Marketers Next Door</a>.</p>
