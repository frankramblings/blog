I"¢<p>An interesting theory recently published in the journal <em>Science</em> proposes that Earth may be the result of two colliding bodies that fused together early on. According to the theory, this impact created both the Earth and the Moon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Astronomers have long suspected that the moon formed after a small, 
proto-planet, called Theia, crashed into Earth, knocking a chunk 
 of rock into Earthâ€™s orbit. New research by scientists at the 
 University of California Los Angeles suggests that Theia didnâ€™t 
merely sideswipe Earth, but instead fused with our planet, 
forming both modern Earth and the moon.

The new evidence comes from an analysis of oxygen isotopes 
from both volcanic rocks and lunar rocks that were brought 
to Earth as part of the Apollo missions. The astronomers 
found that the isotopes share a unique fingerprint, 
something that could only happen if matter from Theia and 
Earth thoroughly mixed together in a head-on collision.
