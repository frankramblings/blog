<p><a href="http://transition.io/the-mac-is-back/">This post</a> from iOS developer Marc Palmer proposes a theory that makes a whole lot of sense to me: what if the Mac Pro and the iMac lines merge? Right now there are MacBooks and MacBook Pros. There is a Mac Pro, but nothing simply called Mac. It would seem consistent with Apple tradition to have a Mac and Mac Pro (both all-in-one machines), in addition to the MacBook and MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>I really like this idea. It feels right. It would simplify the product line significantly, and it would bring things back to the original 2×2 grid Steve Jobs introduced when he returned to Apple in the late 90s.</p>
