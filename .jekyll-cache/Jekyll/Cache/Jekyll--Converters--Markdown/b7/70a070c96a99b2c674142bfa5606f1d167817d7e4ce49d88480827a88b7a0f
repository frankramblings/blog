<p><strong>US:</strong> Why can’t we just pay for the cable channels we actually want a la carte?</p>

<p>(a few years later)</p>

<p><strong>ALSO US:</strong> Why do we have to pay for all these streaming services individually? Can’t there be some kind of package to save money?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The general idea is that each of<br />
 these TV services will appeal to<br />
 cord-cutters and cord-nevers who<br />
 merely consider old-style cable and<br />
 satellite TV too costly. To<br />
 overcome that, each offers what are<br />
 called “skinny bundles” of<br />
 channels, with fewer, at various<br />
 prices.</p>

  <p>The last thing we need is to just<br />
 port outmoded cable and satellite<br />
 services to the internet.</p>
