<p>Cassini is beginning its Grand Finale in style. It passed within 600 miles of Saturnâ€™s moon Titan, and now itâ€™s entering into a death spiral as it gets closer and closer to crashing into the surface of Saturn in late September. The photography weâ€™ll get between now and then should be phenomenal!</p>

<p>For updates on Cassini, be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/CassiniSaturn">@CassiniSaturn</a> on Twitter. And for a Twitter bot that is sad about Cassini ending, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/CassiniNooo">@CassiniNooo</a>. Itâ€™s hilarious.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cassini will perform another 21 dives through the same gap, beaming back more information about the planet and its beautiful rings, before plunging into Saturn itself to burn up in its atmosphere</p>
