<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14309282/andrew-weir-nasa-mission-control-tv-show">Oh I would watch the hell out of a show like this.</a> If it gets ordered to series I’ll be very excited.

around the next generation of NASA<br />
astronauts and scientists who juggle<br />
their personal and professional<br />
