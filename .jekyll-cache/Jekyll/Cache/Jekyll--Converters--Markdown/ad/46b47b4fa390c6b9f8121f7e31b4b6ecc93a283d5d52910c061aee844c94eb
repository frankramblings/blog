<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14309282/andrew-weir-nasa-mission-control-tv-show">Oh I would watch the hell out of a show like this.</a> If it gets ordered to series Iâ€™ll be very excited. I loved <em>The Martian</em> , both the novel and the movie. Andy Weir is the perfect writer for a show like this.</p>
