I"<p>So as many of you know, Jan 2 is my birthday. Some people think having a birthday so close to Christmas means being overshadowed by it. Personally, I rather enjoy it. Itâ€™s not as though I have a choice anyway, but I donâ€™t mind it at all. So I thought Iâ€™d give you a little list of my Christmas &amp; Birthday presents just because I feel like it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 GB RAM for my laptop</li>
  <li><em>Smallville</em> Season 7 DVD</li>
  <li><em>Wall-E</em> 3 Disc Special Edition</li>
  <li><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em> 2 Disc Special Edition</li>
  <li><em>Dr. Horribleâ€™s Sing-Along Blog</em> DVD</li>
  <li><em>Superman Theatrical Serials</em> DVD</li>
  <li><em>The Adventures of Superman Original TV Soundtrack</em> CD</li>
  <li>The obligatory clothes, cash &amp; gift cards</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad pay day. Iâ€™m more than happy! Iâ€™ve got tons of DVDs to watch. Looking forward to seeing all of it! Iâ€™ve already listened to the Superman soundtrack and I <em>love</em> it. The music is so iconic! I could hear the sound effects from the show playing in my head as I listened. Also, the liner notes were excellent. They were written by a true fan who did his homework. They tell the story behind the music while expressing what makes the pieces so special to so many people. Great stuff!</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone on Twitter and Facebook for the kind birthday wishes! There were too many to respond individually. I guess Iâ€™m just too loved. ðŸ˜‰ But sincerely from the bottom of my heart, thanks to you all!</p>
