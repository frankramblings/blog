I"Z<p>Someone tell me this is an early April Fools Day joke. This Smart Battery Case is the ugliest Apple product I can remember being released in my lifetime. On the bright side it adds little height and length to your phone, which gives it an advantage over the Mophie and similar battery cases; but on the other hand, that <strong><em>bump</em></strong>!</p>

<p>It’s an eyesore. A departure for Apple, in a couple of ways. First, I can’t imagine it’s comfortable to hold this case in your hand with that bump sticking out the back. This isn’t a huge surprise for users of the newest Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard who tell us that they sacrifice usability for aesthetics. Still, at least those products look nice. They have <em>some</em> redeeming qualities. This case doesn’t even have that.</p>

<p>I really don’t like this thing. I’ll stick with my Jackery, thank you very much.</p>
