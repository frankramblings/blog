I"	<p>This Christmas, I’m struck by the humility that this day represents.</p>

<p>God chose to take human form.</p>

<p>He chose to be born to a family living in poverty.</p>

<p>He chose to be born in a country occupied by a hostile empire.</p>

<p>He chose to be born in a stable that smelled like farm animals.</p>

<p>He chose to be laid in a food trough for those animals.</p>

<p>As a child, “He was subject to” Mary and Joseph.</p>

<p>God himself grew up as the apprentice to a simple carpenter.</p>

<p>He fetched water. He tended to the fireplace. He swept the floor.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’m thinking about today. If the God of the universe was humble enough to make himself so lowly, I need to remember to be more humble too.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
