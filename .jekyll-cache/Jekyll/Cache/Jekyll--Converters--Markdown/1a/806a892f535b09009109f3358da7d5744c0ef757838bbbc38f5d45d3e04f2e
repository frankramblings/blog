  <p>So huge swaths of tomorrowâ€™s Apple media event appear to have been leaked. [â€¦] Still, itâ€™s a little like saying that reading a set list is a replacement for attending a concert. The appeal of an Apple product launch is not a productâ€™s spec sheet, itâ€™s the <em>reveal</em>. (If you want to test this, refuse to watch an Apple product launch sometime and limit yourself to the Tech Specs pages. Good luck.)</p>
