I"r<div src="v5"><div>Lately I’ve been checking out Digg.com a lot. Pretty much daily. Lately it’s been Obama-central, but hopefully that will slow down after next week. It’s usually a great place for interesting and funny news. If you like bizarre but true stories, have a look. Here’s a prime example:</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(81, 100, 107); line-height: 33px; ">[The Muppet’s Animal Caught Speeding, Driving Police Crazy](http://gizmodo.com/5069422/the-muppets-animal-caught-speeding-driving-police-crazy)</span></div><div>See? Hilarious and true! Stuff like this pops up constantly on Digg. Then there’s also interesting pop culture stuff:</div><div></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 122, 170); ">[It’s official: Robert Downey Jr. will suit up for ‘The Avengers,’ Jon Favreau on board as an executive producer](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/its-official-ro.html)</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 122, 170);">  
</span></div><div>That particular story makes me very happy, by the way. I loved <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Iron Man.</span> And I’m not a fan of the character, nor Marvel Comics in general. I’m looking forward to this <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Avengers</span> movie. I know pretty much nothing about The Avengers, and in a way I want to keep it that way so I can enjoy the version of the story they decide to give us in the film. Anyway, check out Digg. They’re rather awesome. Incidentally, they have a podcast, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">DiggNation</span>, which I’ll be reviewing soon as the next installment of my “Podcastin'” series.</div><div></div>[![Digg!](http://digg.com/img/badges/100x20-digg-button.gif)  ](http://digg.com/)
