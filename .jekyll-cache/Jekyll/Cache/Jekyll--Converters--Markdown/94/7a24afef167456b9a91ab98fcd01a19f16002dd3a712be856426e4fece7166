Really liking this new tweaked look. Not a complete overhaul like the New 52 brought us, but a few small changes to bring back some elements of the classic look. The briefs arenâ€™t making a comeback yet, but Iâ€™ll take it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most significantly, the signature<br />
 red boots are back, although in an<br />
 apparently metallic form to match<br />
 Supermanâ€™s belt, which is now more<br />
 pronounced and topped off with a<br />
 shield-shaped gold buckle. The<br />
 gauntlet-style arms are gone, too,<br />
 replaced with simple cuffs.</p>
