I"Í<p>I canâ€™t tell you how insanely busy Iâ€™ve been the last couple of weeks. It really bothers me that I havenâ€™t been posting here very much, but I seriously havenâ€™t had the chance. Between school and <a href="http://echoalert.tk/">Echo Alert</a>, my plate is full. Iâ€™ve been trying for the past month to find the time to record an <a href="http://frankpodcast.tk/">FMF</a> episode, but every single time Iâ€™ve tried to set aside the time, something gets in the way. Itâ€™s been kind of a mess. Iâ€™m going to try again this weekend and it had better work out this time because itâ€™s been well over a month since the last episode. Echo Alert has been off to a great start. Andrew and I never expected it to take off so well. Weâ€™ve been featured on iTunesâ€™ TV &amp; Film Podcast front page under the â€œNew &amp; Notableâ€ section almost since the beginning, and weâ€™ve ranked as high as #22 out of all TV &amp; Film Audio Podcasts! Itâ€™s pretty insane. People are downloading our episodes by the thousands. Iâ€™m overwhelmed whenever I look at our stats page. So if youâ€™re among our listeners, thank you so much for your continuing support. Knowing people out there are listening really motivates us to improve the show for you guys.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s about it, I guess. Iâ€™m going to try and post here more often, but midterms are next week so I canâ€™t make any promises. I try to avoid general Life posts and keep the blog restricted to stories of specific interest to me, but since I know that several people actually do read this, I thought I should let you know whatâ€™s up. Thanks for bearing with me.</p>
