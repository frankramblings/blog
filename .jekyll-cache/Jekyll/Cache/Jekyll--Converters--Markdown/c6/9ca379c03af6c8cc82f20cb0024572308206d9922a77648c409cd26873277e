I"ê<p>Walt Mossberg outlines the 7 things heâ€™d like to see in the next iPhone, and his list looks a lot like mine. Especially better battery life, durability, and fast charging. Iâ€™d love it if I didnâ€™t need a phone case, either for protection or added battery life. Just add wireless charging to this list and youâ€™d have a near-perfect device.</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€œFirst of all â€” and this is very tough scientifically â€” 
Apple could make a big leap in battery life. The company 
has long done a decent job for people who are moderate users, 
or who, like me, have great cell tower proximity, which keeps 
the phone from battery-draining tower searches. But I know too 
many iPhone users who are forced to recharge their phones multiple 
times a day or carry around bulky extra-battery cases or portable 
chargers. Apple even brought out such a case itself recently. 
Fixing battery life would be a huge win.â€
