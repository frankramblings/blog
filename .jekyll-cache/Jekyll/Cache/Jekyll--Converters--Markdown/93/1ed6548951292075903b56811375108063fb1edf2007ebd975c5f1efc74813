I"	<p>A few months ago, I reviewed Windows 7 here. At the time, I was using the Beta version. Since then, I’ve upgraded to the full version that was officially released two weeks ago. I’m happy to say I’ve posted an updated review over at YuBlog.org, a great blog dedicated to user-submitted content. I hope to continue submitting articles there in the future. <a href="http://yublog.org/2009/11/03/windows-7-did-microsoft-get-it-right-frank-emanuele/trackback/">You can read the article here.</a> Leave comments!</p>
