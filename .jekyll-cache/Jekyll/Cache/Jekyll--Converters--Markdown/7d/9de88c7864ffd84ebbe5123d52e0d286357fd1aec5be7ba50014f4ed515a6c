they have the answer. Potatoes. Researchers at the Lima-based 
International Potato Center and scientists at the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration are studying which type 
of potato could be best suited for extraterrestrial farming 
to support a human settlement on Mars. If everything goes as 
planned, the Martian colonies could be munching on french fries, 
chips and mashed potatoes one day.â€
