I"Ü<p>Iâ€™m sure readers of this blog have noticed that I havenâ€™t been posting as frequently as Iâ€™d like to recently. Thatâ€™s partly because Iâ€™ve taken on lots of hobbies (possibly too many for my own good), but itâ€™s also because whenever I <em>do</em> think about writing, a suitable subject doesnâ€™t come to min as readily as it once did. When I first started this project, I had a few staple features to fall back on whenever I couldnâ€™t think of something original. There was the â€œPodcastinâ€™ â€ series, which I never officially ended and might start up again some time. Then during the 2008 Presidential Election, I wrote opinion pieces and posted news stories here.</p>

<p>So maybe what I really need to do is resurrect the Podcastinâ€™ series, come up with some new regular features, and then plug in the gaps with whatever pops into my mind. Part of the writerâ€™s block Iâ€™ve been experiencing comes from a feeling of pressure. Iâ€™m committed to keeping this blog afloat, and sometimes my desire to keep it going makes it hard to decide what to write about because I want it to be of some quality. So Iâ€™m rededicating myself to this blog and updating it at least once a week. I look forward to writing more often!</p>
