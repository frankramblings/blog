I"°<div src="v5"><div>Oh this is awesome. Recently Spike TVâ€™s 2008 Scream Awards featured a new trailer for 2009â€™s big screen adaptation of the most revered graphic novel of all time <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Watchmen</span>. Having read the book myself recently in preparation for the filmâ€™s release, I can vouch for its high levels of awesomeness. If you havenâ€™t read it, do yourself a favor and pick it up. You can find it at any bookstore like Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble. â€œAbsoluteâ€ and regular hardcover editions are due out in the next few weeks, so it might be worth the wait. For a quick synopsis of the film, check out the videoâ€™s description on the YouTube page.</div><div><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zRiuGRAU7WI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" />&lt;/param&gt;<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />&lt;/param&gt;<embed allowfullscreen="true" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zRiuGRAU7WI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" />&lt;/embed&gt;</object></div>[
