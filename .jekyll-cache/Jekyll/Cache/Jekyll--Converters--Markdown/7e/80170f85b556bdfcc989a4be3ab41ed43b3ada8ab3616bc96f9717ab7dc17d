<p>Joe Biden has done it again. He has unwittingly worked to convince more and more people to vote for John McCain. In a speech at a Seattle fundraiser Sunday, Biden warned the crowd that within the first six months of an Obama-Biden administration, â€œWatch, weâ€™re gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy.â€ He added â€œThere are gonna be a lot of you who want to go, â€˜Whoa, wait a minute, yo, whoa, whoa, I donâ€™t know about that decisionâ€™. Because if you think the decision is sound when theyâ€™re made, which I believe you will when theyâ€™re made, theyâ€™re not likely to be as popular as they are sound. Because if theyâ€™re popular, theyâ€™re probably not sound.â€ OK, first of all, by that logic, most of George Bushâ€™s policies are sound, because most of them are unpopular. Secondly, it seems painfully clear to me that Biden is admitting that Obama has no practical executive experience whatsoever, and will have no idea what on Earth heâ€™s doing. â€œSo Iâ€™m asking you now, Iâ€™m asking you now, be prepared to stick with us. Remember the faith you had at this point because youâ€™re going to have to reinforce us,â€ he said. In other words, if we screw up, remember that you elected us! If this is what the Obama campaign has to offer, then Iâ€™ll be casting my ballot for John McCain this November, thank you very much. Why should I vote for Obama if his running mate is promising us more challenges and more complications? John McCain isnâ€™t asking anyone to have â€œfaithâ€ in him and â€œreinforceâ€ him and hope the nasties will go away. He has concrete, straightforward plans to deal with the financial crisis and with the possibility of an energy crisis.</p>

<p>Putting the icing on the cake, fifteen minutes into his speech, Biden commented, â€œI probably shouldnâ€™t have said all this because it dawned on me that the press is here.â€ Nice. When is the press ever <em>not</em> there, Joe? Youâ€™re running for Vice President, remember? You have to be more careful when warning supporters that their candidate is too weak to serve them as President. Letâ€™s be honest here folks. Obama picked Biden to give his campaign an air of credibility. No one will deny Bidenâ€™s 35 years of Senate experience, but even his staunchest supporters must admit he has never known when or how to hold his tongue. Itâ€™s a wonder that after several public racial slurs and the frank admission that he is not the most qualified candidate for Vice President, Obama has let him stick around. Heâ€™s just as much a liability as he is an asset. And thatâ€™s being generous.</p>
