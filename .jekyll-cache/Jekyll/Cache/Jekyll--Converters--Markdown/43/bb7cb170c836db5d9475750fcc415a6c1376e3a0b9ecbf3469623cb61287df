I"Â<p>Stories for everybody! Twitter is opening their Moments feature to the public, because Instagram Stories happened and now itâ€™s time to respond. The existing Moments tab will likely stay the same, but Moments created by individuals will be similar to moments currently created by brands and influencers. They will be accessible via a button on the userâ€™s profile that will take you to their Moments.</p>

<p>This strikes me as something they should have rolled out publicly from the beginning, but the Instagram launch may have accelerated their timeline.</p>

(which has already copied Moments, mind you) 
polished the feature off. Moments is likely the 
best of the three, but who wants to wait for it?â€
