I"•<p>So a while back I listed some TV shows and movies I planned to watch. Iâ€™m not making as much progress as Iâ€™d hoped, but hereâ€™s how itâ€™s going so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Terminator</em> â€” DONE</li>
  <li><em>Terminator 2</em> â€” DONE</li>
  <li><em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em> â€” DONE</li>
  <li><em>Firefly</em> â€” IN PROGRESS</li>
  <li><em>Serenity</em></li>
  <li><em>Supernatural</em></li>
  <li><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></li>
  <li><em>Angel</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I watched T1, T2, and the first several episodes of T:SCC in a single day. I finished the whole series in just a few days. It was glorious. AMAZING show! Definitely the most underrated and best-written show on television. Not my favorite (that would be <em>Smallville</em>), but it is the most well-written.</p>

<p>Then I got started on <em>Firefly</em> and hit a brick wall. I havenâ€™t been able to watch more than 1 or 2 episodes in a sitting. Things seem to keep getting in the way. Itâ€™s an awesome show as well, and I canâ€™t figure out how it got canceled other than the fact that FOX has an itchy trigger finger. Iâ€™m halfway through it now and I plan to finish it and watch Serenity, the movie that accompanies it.</p>

<p>However, at the suggestions of several people, especially my friends Tim and Faith, Iâ€™ve added the CWâ€™s Supernatual to the list. The show is ending soon, so Iâ€™d like to get caught up before it goes off the air. Once Iâ€™m caught up, Iâ€™ll continue with Buffy and eventually Angel. To be perfectly honest, Iâ€™m not really pumped for Angel, so depending how I feel about Buffy, I may or may not go through with Angel. We shall see.</p>
