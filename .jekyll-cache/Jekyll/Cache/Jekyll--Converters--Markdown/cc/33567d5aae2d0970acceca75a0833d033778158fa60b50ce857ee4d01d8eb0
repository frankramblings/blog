I"<p>Jason Snell writes on Yahoo! Tech today that one of the astronomers who helped bring our solar system down to 8 planets may be building a case to bring it back up to 9.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A decade ago Mike Brown helped get Pluto demoted from a “planet” 
to a mere “dwarf planet.” Now the astronomer and one of his CalTech 
colleagues may have plotted the orbit of a new ninth planet in our 
solar system, dramatically larger than Pluto and much, much farther away.
