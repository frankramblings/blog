I"ü<p>The story about Sir Alec Guinness you havenâ€™t heard anywhere else: at age 42 he experienced a miracle that changed his life and converted him to Catholicism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€œHe made a deal with God: if God healed his son Matthew, 
he would allow his son to become Catholic if he wanted. 
â€Against all expectations (miraculously?), his son recovered! 
So Guinness and his wife enrolled him in a Jesuit school. 
A few years later, Guinness, his wife, and his son all 
converted to Catholicism.â€
