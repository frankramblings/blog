Incidentally, last Saturday, CNBCâ€™s Larry Kudlow predicted a 1000-point Dow rally the day after a McCain victory. While this prediction doesnâ€™t necessarily mean thatâ€™s what would have happened, it is interesting to note that upon the election of the candidate who promised economic stability and prosperity, the market took a historic turn for the worse. What does Wall Street know that we donâ€™t know? Hmm? Or maybe we <em>do</em> know, but were so mesmerized by a man who never says anything that we voted foolishly. Yeah, maybe thatâ€™s it.</p>
