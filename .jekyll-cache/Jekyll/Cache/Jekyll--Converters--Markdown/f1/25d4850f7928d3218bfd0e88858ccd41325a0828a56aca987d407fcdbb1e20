Well, I canâ€™t believe it, but itâ€™s finally here. Tomorrow night (well, technically tonight), I board a plane to North Carolina. Iâ€™m meeting up with friends and driving down to Atlanta for Dragon\*Con! I bought my pass way back in November, and already itâ€™s time to head South and enjoy a weekend of fun and geekiness!

Dragon\*Con is one of the biggest sci-fi/fantasy/pop culture conventions on the East Coast, featuring novelists, comic book creators, TV and film actors in panel discussions, signing autographs, and just hanging out with their fans. Iâ€™ve already been to New York Comic Con and Big Apple Con, but from what I hear, this is supposed to be a very different experience. I canâ€™t wait!

Iâ€™m looking forward to getting to know my friends Faith and Ky a little better, as well as meeting my friends Chris and Louis in real life for the first time. Itâ€™s going to be great to hang out with these people who I know from Twitter.

But of course, it wouldnâ€™t be Dragon\*Con without some good geekery! Iâ€™ve loaded up on comics to read while Iâ€™m in line for panels and autographs (10 trades and about 30 single issues on my iPod Touch), and Iâ€™ve got a mental list of people I need to meet before the weekend is out: Summer Glau, Kevin J. Anderson, Timothy Zahn, Veronica Belmont, Tom Merritt, Brian Brushwood, Jeff Lewis, Sandeep Parikh, and a few others. Also, Iâ€™m excited about getting to sit in on some panels and enjoy some great parties. If all goes well, it should be a great weekend.

If things go right, Iâ€™ll be checking in here each night during the convention and throwing up a quick post filled with the latest from that day. Canâ€™t wait!
