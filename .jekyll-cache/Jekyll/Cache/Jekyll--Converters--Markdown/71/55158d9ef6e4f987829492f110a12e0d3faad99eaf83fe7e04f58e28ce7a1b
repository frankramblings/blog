The Nintendo Switch is aptly titled, as it lets users switch back and forth from big-screen console gameplay to an on-the-go tablet experience. They’re doing some very slick things that let you use the same controllers no matter which configuration you’re in. Nintendo has a tradition of great portables as well as consoles, but they have been famously slow to jump on board with modern mobile OSes until recently. Between the recent iOS announcement and this Switch announcement, maybe they’re finally catching up!</p>
