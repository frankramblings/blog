I"£<div src="v5">If you havenâ€™t seen this yet, your life is officially incomplete. Dr. Horribleâ€™s Sing-Along Blog is a short web musical film that was written, produced &amp; directed by Joss Whedon &amp; his brothers Zack &amp; Jed, as well as Jedâ€™s FiancÃ© Maurissa Tancharoen. It was a product of the Writers Guild of America strike that nearly brought TV and movie production to a stand-still from late 2007 through early 2008. It is a hilarious and delightful piece of work that everyone needs to see. Please check it out! Itâ€™s short and free!
