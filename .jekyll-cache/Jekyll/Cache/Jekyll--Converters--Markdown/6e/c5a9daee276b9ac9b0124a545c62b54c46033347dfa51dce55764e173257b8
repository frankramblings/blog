I"à<p>I think it was around 2007 that I began blogging under the name Frank Ramblings. At times Iâ€™ve been really consistent, and at other times Iâ€™ve lost my groove. Iâ€™ve moved the site from Blogger to Tumblr to WordPress to Squarespace. Iâ€™ve been in a less-bloggy state of mind for a couple of years now, but always with the intention to dive back in at some point. The idea of a personal, owned piece of web real estate is important to me, and I like the freedom to take my content with me from platform to platform without the fear of losing it all because a particular social network didnâ€™t close another series of funding.</p>

<p>Plus, with the recent trend of more and more independent bloggers using their sites as hubs for sharing a mix of content include long- and short-form writing, podcasts, and links, I think the time is finally right for me to give this another honest try. I tip my hat to the writers who have inspired this new initiative, specifically <a href="https://sixcolors.com/">Jason Snell</a>, <a href="http://ihnatko.com/">Andy Ihnatko</a>, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/">Federico Viticci</a> and <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/">Stephen Hackett</a>. I hope to create something here in the same vein.</p>
