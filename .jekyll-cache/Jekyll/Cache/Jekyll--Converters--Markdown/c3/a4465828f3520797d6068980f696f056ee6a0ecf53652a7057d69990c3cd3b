I"â<div src="v5"><div id="_mcePaste"><div><div id="_mcePaste">So as Iâ€™ve been reading Twitter the last couple of days, Iâ€™ve noticed that a lot of people are bidding â€œgood riddanceâ€ to 2009. Iâ€™m a little surprised, to be honest. It was actually a pretty awesome year for me. I really feel like I grew a lot this year as a person. My horizons were broadened on a number of levels and my eyes were opened to new points of view. I fell in love with technology all over again. I really embraced my geeky side more than ever before. I enjoyed more genre TV and movies than I ever have. I recorded hundreds of podcasts. I made dozens of new friends. And I took some pretty big steps on my journey towards a new media career.</div><div>Iâ€™m very thankful for the experiences I had this year. Between the awesome classes Iâ€™ve been taking in school, the dozens of podcasts I listen to, and the tweets and blogs I read every day, Iâ€™ve become even more aware and interested in new media and emerging technology than I already was. Itâ€™s been an incredible year.</div></div><div>Most of all, Iâ€™m thankful for the great friends Iâ€™ve made this year, especially on Twitter. I was always skeptical about making friends over the internet. I didnâ€™t understand how a friendship could really develop if two people werenâ€™t spending time together. And yet, Iâ€™m now a big believer. Some of the people Iâ€™ve met on Twitter are as close or closer to me than some friends Iâ€™ve made â€œin real lifeâ€. So thanks to all of you. You know who you are. Of course, Iâ€™m just as thankful for old friends as I am for new ones. My long-lasting friendships grew and became closer in 2009 than in previous years too. My sincere thanks go out to those friends as well.</div><div>Overall, 2009 was a huge year for me. Itâ€™s a year Iâ€™ll remember for a long time. I feel that I grew more as a person in 2009 than in any other year of my life to date. I look forward to the amazing ride that will be 2010. Iâ€™m really excited to finish my Junior year of college, to start working at a new job, and to experience all the new challenges that are headed my way. I canâ€™t wait to look back on 2010, and when I do, I hope I will remember it as fondly as I remember 2009.</div></div></div>
