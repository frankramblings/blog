I"•<p>So I‚Äôve known since the beginning of the semester that I have a paper due for my Ethics class during the 11th week of the semester. I also had a paper due the 7th week of the semester in my Religions of the World class. That was two weeks ago. So it seemed to me that if week 7 was 2 weeks ago, this must be week 9, right? Right, unless your Theology professor miscounted and told you that it was week 7, when in fact it was already week 9. That would mean <em>this</em> week is actually week 11. Woops. So now I have until Friday to write a 3-5 page paper and 10-15 oral presentation on the ethical practices of PETA. Not impossible by any means, but an unforeseen annoyance nonetheless. I did some research this morning, and I found some very interesting results. Turns out People for the ‚ÄúEthical‚Äù Treatment of Animals aren‚Äôt so ethical after all. I‚Äôll post more once I‚Äôve written the paper. So far though, it looks like they go to fanatical, often human-life-threatening extremes, all in the name of protecting animal rights. A bit whacko, if you ask me. I fully expect to be shunned by my classmates and all but flunked by the professor, but the truth is the truth, like it or not. In other news, I‚Äôve started using Twitter. For those who don‚Äôt know, Twitter is a micro-blogging site. It‚Äôs a place where you can write quick updates of what‚Äôs going on in your life at any given moment from the web or via text message. I‚Äôve been updating somewhat frequently in the last couple of days. It‚Äôs actually pretty fun, because you can keep up with other people as well. Their updates show up on your home page as a feed. I‚Äôve been following friends, acquaintances, news services, and my favorite podcasters and celebrities. It‚Äôs quite cool. You can communicate directly with them by replying to their ‚Äútweets‚Äù, or posts. Great site. Follow me at <a href="http://twitter.com/frankramblings">twitter.com/frankramblings</a></p>
