I"×<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/5/12095924/ios-10-beta-organ-donor-registration-apple">This is a really interesting move</a>, in keeping with Appleâ€™s recent trend towards health. I canâ€™t help but wonder if Steve Jobsâ€™s own liver transplant inspired this feature.</p>

<p>Facebook has been encouraging organ donation since 2013, and just a day after they launched that functionality, <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/the_facebook_effect_social_media_dramatically_boosts_organ_donor_registration">Johns Hopkins</a> reported a 21-fold uptick in interest. I can only wonder what impact Appleâ€™s feature will have on increasing awareness. Either way, I applaud them for their continued commitment to such noble causes.</p>
