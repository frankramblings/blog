I"†<div src="v5">Twice in the last three weeks, Iâ€™ve guest-hosted [Castlecast](http://castlecast.libsyn.com), a podcast about ABCâ€™s Castle (starring Nathan Fillion). Iâ€™ve been listening to the podcast since it started this summer, and Iâ€™ve really been enjoying it. [John](http://twitter.com/johnpavlich) and [Heidi](http://twitter.com/hjkuzcotopia) do a great job recapping and discussing new episodes, delivering Castle-related news, and talking about spoilers for upcoming episodes. Heidi hasnâ€™t been able to host the show lately (feel better, Heidi!), so Johnâ€™s been asking his fellow podcasters to step in. I was on the podcast two weeks ago for [Episode 9: Fool Me Once](http://castlecast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=539556) and again this week for [Episode 11: Vampire Weekend](http://castlecast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=544452). The most recent episode was a panel discussion featuring John, [Crystal](http://twitter.com/starrfyre), [Larissa](http://twitter.com/piratescribe), [Nathaniel](http://twitter.com/nathanieletc), and myself. I had a great time on Castlecast and I hope to be on it again some time. Thanks John and Heidi!</div>
