<p>The social web is abuzz with the news of Google+ Pages finally being launched yesterday. After initially deleting personal profiles set up by brands, Google is finally allowing them to set up pages similar to those already available on Facebook. But are these pages really ready for primetime? What could they be doing better?</p>

<p><strong>Group Posting</strong></p>

<p>Right now, only one person can be the admin of a page. That means whoever creates the page is the only one who can post to it. This poses a pretty serious issue for most brands who currently rely on a team to manage their social media presence. You‚Äôll either have to share the Gmail account that created the page, or just leave it to one person to be your go-to Google+ guy. And keep in mind that even if you do decide to share that Gmail account, you won‚Äôt be able to keep track of who is posting what!</p>

<p><strong>The +1 Button</strong></p>

<p>So you find a page that you want to follow. On Facebook, you‚Äôd normally ‚ÄúLike‚Äù the page, so on Google+, you‚Äôd click the big shiny +1 button below the profile image, right? WRONG! Clicking the +1 button on a Google+ page has the same effect as clicking the +1 button on a website or in a Google search. It doesn‚Äôt affect whether or not you‚Äôre following the brand and receiving their updates; it just tells your friends that you‚Äôre interested in the brand. That‚Äôs all. To actively follow the brand, you have to add them to your Circles. For me, that‚Äôs a little confusing and unnecessary. I spent my Monday night exploring new Google+ pages and clicking +1, thinking that the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù metaphor would apply. Now I‚Äôll have to go back and Circle those pages. And what Circles do I put them in? Maybe I‚Äôm spoiled by Facebook, but I don‚Äôt want to evaluate which Circle makes sense for each brand I follow. I just want to click and forget it!</p>

<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>

<p>How do I know what‚Äôs working for my page and what isn‚Äôt? Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn all offer pretty robust Insights into who your fans are and what content they find most interesting on your page. Right now, Google+ offers no such thing, not even on a basic level. You‚Äôd think Google Analytics would come bundled with your Google+ page, right? Well, apparently not. At least, not yet. We‚Äôll see what happens there. But until brands can take a critical look at their performance (and while we‚Äôre at it, peek at the performance of competitors), it‚Äôs going to be really hard to set benchmarks and accurately gauge success.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the biggest issues I have with Google+ pages right now. Will they be fixed eventually? I‚Äôm sure they will! Who knows? They may even be fixed relatively soon! But for now, they‚Äôre definitely worth considering before you pull the trigger.</p>
