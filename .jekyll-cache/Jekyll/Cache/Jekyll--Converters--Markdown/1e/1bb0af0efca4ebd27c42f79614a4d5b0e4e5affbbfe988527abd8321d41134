I"ø<div src="v5">So as many of you know, Jan 2 is my birthday. Some people think having a birthday so close to Christmas means being overshadowed by it. Personally, I rather enjoy it. Itâ€™s not as though I have a choice anyway, but I donâ€™t mind it at all. So I thought Iâ€™d give you a little list of my Christmas &amp; Birthday presents just because I feel like it. - 4 GB RAM for my laptop
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallville</span> Season 7 DVD
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall-E</span> 3 Disc Special Edition
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</span> 2 Disc Special Edition
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Dr. Horribleâ€™s Sing-Along Blog</span> DVD
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Superman</span> Theatrical Serials DVD
- <span style="font-style: italic;">The Adventures of Superman</span> Original TV Soundtrack CD
- The obligatory clothes, cash &amp; gift cards

Not a bad pay day. Iâ€™m more than happy! Iâ€™ve got tons of DVDs to watch. Looking forward to seeing all of it! Iâ€™ve already listened to the Superman soundtrack and I <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">love</span> it. The music is so iconic! I could hear the sound effects from the show playing in my head as I listened. Also, the liner notes were excellent. They were written by a true fan who did his homework. They tell the story behind the music while expressing what makes the pieces so special to so many people. Great stuff!

Thanks to everyone on Twitter and Facebook for the kind birthday wishes! There were too many to respond individually. I guess Iâ€™m just too loved. ðŸ˜‰ But sincerely from the bottom of my heart, thanks to you all!
