<p>The Atlantic just published this incredible piece by Nicholas Dawidoff that is an essential read for anyone at all interested in the Beatles.</p>

<p>A good summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œA Day in the Lifeâ€ isnâ€™t a song to sing, as are â€œEleanor Rigbyâ€ (ideal for both car and karaoke), â€œHey Judeâ€ (written to soothe John Lennonâ€™s young son, no lullaby works better at childrenâ€™s bedtime), or â€œIn My Lifeâ€ (a perennial at weddings and funerals and, I canâ€™t help mentioning, rockâ€™s analog to Shakespeareâ€™s Sonnet 116). Nor is â€œA Day in the Lifeâ€ guided by melody like so many Beatles creations. Itâ€™s an elaborate production, filled with sophisticated George Martin and Geoff Emerick musical trickery (distortion, echo, dubbing, reverb). An orchestra plays, and then one singerâ€™s voice gives way to anotherâ€™sâ€”Johnâ€™s worldly reflections transitioning to Paulâ€™s sketch of domestic memoir, and then back againâ€”before orchestral cataclysm and a final resting place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the story behind the famous chord that lasted forever:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then, after all the chaos and destruction, what next? George Harrison had suggested a fade to humming. But it didnâ€™t work. Paul thought that the song needed firmer resolution. Three Steinway pianos and a harmonium were rolled into action, and at every keyboard the players were instructed to hit the single chord of E major simultaneously and hard, with the sustain foot pedal down, letting it carry as long as possible. There were nine takes. The tone is so big, so capacious and resonant because Martin and Emerick thought to put the recorder on half speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I canâ€™t stress what a well-written piece this is. Some really insightful lyrical analysis, too.</p>
