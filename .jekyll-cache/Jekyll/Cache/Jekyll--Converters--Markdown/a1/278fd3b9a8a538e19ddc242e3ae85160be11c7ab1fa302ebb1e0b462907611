I"C<p>Twitter has suggested people to follow for years. Since the ill-fated Suggested User List, which led to a small number of celebrities like Ashton Kutcher gaining an extreme number of followers in the early days, Twitter has tried to be more strategic in the way they recommend new accounts. This is a logical progression in their ongoing effort to suggest people you might want to Tweet with.</p>

<p>“To give you the best recommendations — which we’ll continue to refine over time — we look at who you already follow, Tweets you like, popular accounts in your local area, what’s happening in the world right now, and more. We’ll also let you know exactly why we’re showing you each recommendation.”</p>
