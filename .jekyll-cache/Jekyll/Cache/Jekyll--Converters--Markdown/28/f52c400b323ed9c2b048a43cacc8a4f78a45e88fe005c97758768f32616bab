I"L<p>On the 35th anniversary of his death, I find myself listening to my favorite John Lennon song. (Just Like) Starting Over is the first track off <em>Double Fantasy,</em> the last album he recorded<em>.</em> He wrote it at a time when his life was starting to pick up again and he was filled with a new sense of hope and happiness. It’s tragic and ironic that his life was cut short at that point, but this is the John I like to remember. After years of being a cynic who admitted he didn’t much like himself, he was finally growing into his skin, mellowing out, and finding his place in the world. Listen to a John Lennon song today and remember a musical genius.</p>
