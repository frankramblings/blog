<p>Fans of Kevin J. Anderson will be ecstatic to learn that the master is at it again. After the much-acclaimed <em>Last Days of Krypton</em>, which told the story of Supermanâ€™s home planet of Krypton in the days before the Baby of Steel was rocketed off to Earth. This time around, heâ€™s telling the story of Batman &amp; Superman meeting for the first time. It takes place at the height of the Cold War. I canâ€™t wait to pick it up, and now I donâ€™t have to wait quite so long. A 57-page preview has been made available through Harper Collins Publishers. Check it out and enjoy the first eight chapters!</p>
