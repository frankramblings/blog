<p>Weâ€™ve got a special surprise for you. Tim &amp; Frank are joined today by Hank Henshaw himself: David Harewood. He hints at the future of his character and gushes about his passion for comics and how important it is for him to work on a show as meaningful as Supergirl. Our sincere thanks to David for an excellent chat. Enjoy!</p>
