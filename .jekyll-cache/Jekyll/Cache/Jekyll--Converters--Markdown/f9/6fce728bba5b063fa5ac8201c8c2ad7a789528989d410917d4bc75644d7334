I"<p>Lately my passion for the Beatles has been flaring up again in a big way. Rather than blog about it to no end here and tweet about it on my<a href="http://twitter.com/frankramblings"> main Twitter account</a>, I decided it made more sense to create a new outlet to channel my thoughts on all things Beatlish. The result is <a href="http://twitter.com/beatleramblings">@BeatleRamblings</a> paired with <a href="http://beatleramblings.tumblr.com">beatleramblings.tumblr.com</a>. I’ll be giving my spur-of-the-moment thoughts, comments, and reactions on the Twitter account, and blogging and sharing links, pictures, and other media on the Tumblr page. I’m also looking into starting a Beatles podcast. More on that at a later date. For now, please follow, friend, and comment. Thanks!</p>
