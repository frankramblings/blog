I"ù<p>KUDOS TO GRUCCI: NO CHRISTMAS PARADE, NO FIREWORKS</p>
<blockquote>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The internationally known fireworks company, Grucci, 
 has pulled out of an annual Christmas event on Long Island 
because the town of Patchogue decided to break with its 
15-year tradition of holding a Christmas Boat Parade: 
 This year it decided to rename the event the Patchogue 
 Holiday Boat Parade.
 
 Grucci vice president Phil Butler, a vocal critic of the
 secularization of Christmas, accused the paradeâ€™s 
 organizers of â€œusing all the themes of Christmas and 
 plagiarizing all those themes.â€ Grucci is headquartered
 on Long Island.

_Catholic League president Bill Donohue commended Butlerâ€™s decision:
â€œIf more people like Phil Butler stood up to the high 
priests of political correctness, the dumbing-down of 
Christmas would cease. Christmas is the only holiday 
that is singled out by these authoritarians. They do not 
object to Jewish or Muslim holidays, nor do they object 
to holidays like Martin Luther King Day. And they relish 
Kwanzaa celebrations. But when it comes to Christmas, 
they quickly become censors.
â€œSo Kudos to Grucci. Let this be the first of many 
counterpunches thrown at the cultural fascists this year._

<p>Can I just say how happy that makes me? Itâ€™s great to see a pretty major entity, Grucci, taking a stand against the war on Christmas. It really is true that the only holidays people are â€œoffendedâ€ by are the Christian ones. Any public display of Christian religiosity makes people uncomfortable, even scared. But other religions are said to deserve the right to display religious symbols in public for their holy days. And thatâ€™s how it should be. Itâ€™s our first amendment right. But somehow that idea doesnâ€™t apply to Christianity. If itâ€™s unfair to exclude other religions, why is it acceptable to exclude Christians at Christmas, throwing snowmen and reindeer their way for the sake of appeasement? <em>All</em> religions should be treated equally. This means (brace yourself for impact) saying â€œMerry Christmasâ€ when appropriate, publicly displaying Nativity scenes, and saying â€œEasterâ€. Letâ€™s be honest, people. Last year, I remember being frustrated and disgusted by a TV commercial featuring a wife and mother with her family around the Christmas tree talking about â€œHoliday Eve.â€ Seriously? Is it SO horrible to say â€œChristmas Eve?â€ Is there another religion that celebrates some other major holy day specifically on December 24? I donâ€™t think so. Even if Dec. 24 falls during Chanukah, itâ€™s still Christmas Eve. Also, we donâ€™t just have â€œWinter Breakâ€ or â€œSpring Breakâ€ because the Earth is on a tilted axis that creates seasonal change. Stop ignoring the 800 pound gorilla in the room. The real reason for those breaks are Christmas and Easter. Itâ€™s okay to say it. Nothing bad will happen. Unless you have something against the equal treatment of Christians. If thatâ€™s the case, then donâ€™t get defensive when I call you a bigot. Thank you, Grucci, for standing up against political correctness.</p>
