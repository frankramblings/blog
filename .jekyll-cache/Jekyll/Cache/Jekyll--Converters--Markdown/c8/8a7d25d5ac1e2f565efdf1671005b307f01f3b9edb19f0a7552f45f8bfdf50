I"ù<p>Iâ€™m happy to announce that frankramblings.tk is now frankramblings.com! This is actually my first .com domain and Iâ€™m <em>really</em> excited about it. Iâ€™ve been building websites (<a href="http://geocities.com/mangoboy89/Yankees.html">of varying quality</a>) since about 1998 or 1999 and I always wanted a .com, but I could never afford it. But now thanks to <a href="http://godaddy.com">GoDaddy.com</a>, itâ€™s really affordable and completely worth it. I even got a <a href="http://revision3.com/godaddy">promo code</a> to make it amazingly inexpensive. So the .tk domain will still redirect here, but letâ€™s face it, .com is just cooler! I expect to be making some changes around here and start updating more often, so stay tuned.&lt;/div&gt;</p>
