I"c<p>Well this is shaping up to be epic.</p>

<p>“‘We shot a scene that had, like, nine superheroes in it,’ Amell said. ‘Nine people with either powers or super-suits. It was an amazing thing to look out over the scene and see the world that has been built over the course of three-plus years.’”</p>

<p>— Stephen Amell</p>
