<p>At this moment I will do anything to avoid studying for this ethics <br />
midterm. Part one is on Monday. Itâ€™s on terms and definitions. The <br />
prof refused to specify whether it would be written, multiple choice, <br />
or something else. Heâ€™s kind of annoying like that. So I think Iâ€™ll <br />
make a list of the definitions be gave us and try to learn them as <br />
best I can. In other news, I got paid yesterday! It was my first check from this <br />
new writing center tutoring job. I am happy. Now I donâ€™t have to <br />
worry quite so much about cash all the time. Thatâ€™ll make my weekly <br />
trips to the comics shop a little easier on the wallet. I donâ€™t spend <br />
much on comics anyway, but itâ€™s nice to know that I have something of <br />
an income.</p>

<p>As I mentioned yesterday, the new Star Wars: Clone Wars series <br />
premiered last night. Luckily I was able to see it just about an hour <br />
after it aired. Wow. A LOT better than the movie. The movie felt <br />
childish and silly, and while last nightâ€™s episodes were suitable for <br />
young fans, they were still somehow better than the film. It felt more <br />
like the creators were taking themselves and the material seriously. I <br />
really enjoyed it. It was especially great to see Yoda act like the <br />
mischievous sage everyone loved in Empire Strikes Back. Just great. It <br />
was also interesting to finally see in action a Jedi that fans have <br />
heard so much about ever since the prequels were launched: Master Plo <br />
Koon. He was awesome. A no-nonsense, confident guy who never loses his <br />
cool and solves even the most lethal conundrums with simple logic and, <br />
of course, the use of the Force. He reminds me of Mace Windu (Samuel <br />
L. Jacksonâ€™s character, for anyone whoâ€™s not all that big on SW). <br />
Overall, I look forward to the 5 planned seasons of this exciting new <br />
series based on one of my all-time favorite sci-fi sagas.</p>

<p>As for Making Fiends, which premiered this morning, I still havenâ€™t <br />
been able to find it anywhere on the web. Iâ€™m not really surprised by <br />
this, as it probably doesnâ€™t have a big enough following to warrant <br />
recording and uploading, plus itâ€™s on a channel watched mostly by <br />
kids. Still, I had hoped someone would have uploaded it somewhere, <br />
since it does have a decent-sized Internet fan base. Oh well Iâ€™ll keep <br />
looking. If anyone knows where I can find it, lemme no.</p>

<p>Well I guess I should get to work. Just saying it doesnâ€™t mean I wonâ€™t <br />
find some other distraction first, but at least itâ€™s a step in the <br />
right direction.<br />
Peace.<br />
