Fans of Kevin J. Anderson will be ecstatic to learn that the master is at it again. After the much-acclaimed <span style="font-style: italic;">Last Days of Krypton</span>, which told the story of Superman’s home planet of Krypton in the days before the Baby of Steel was rocketed off to Earth. This time around, he’s telling the story of Batman &amp; Superman meeting for the first time. It takes place at the height of the Cold War. I can’t wait to pick it up, and now I don’t have to wait quite so long. A 57-page preview has been made available through Harper Collins Publishers. Check it out and enjoy the first eight chapters!&lt;/div&gt;</p>
