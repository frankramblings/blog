I"%<p>This is pretty timely for me, as I deleted th Facebook app from my phone earlier this week and I haven’t missed it yet. I definitely haven’t regularly updated my status in years, either. Most of what I see there are articles shared by my friends, plus the updates of the small group of my friends who use Facebook as though it were Twitter. If it weren’t required for my job, I could probably stop using Facebook all together and I doubt I’d miss it.</p>
