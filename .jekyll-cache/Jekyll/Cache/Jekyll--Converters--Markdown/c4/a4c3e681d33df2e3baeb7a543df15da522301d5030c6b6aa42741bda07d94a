I"A<p>The Smithsonian is in the process of restoring the 1967 model of the <em>Enterprise</em> used in the original <em>Star Trek</em> series. Anybody want to take a road trip to DC?</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"The restoration is specifically aiming to restore the model to look as it did 
during the filming of the episode The Trouble with Tribbles, aka the 
“last known modification of the ship during the production of Star Trek.” 
By Summer 2016, the Enterprise is scheduled to move to the Boeing 
Milestones of Flight Hall."
