  <p>A handful of bloggers have been abuzz in the past week with news of the latest under-the-radar Burger King promotion. The fast food chain has dispensed agents across major U.S. cities (indications are it’s just been Chicago and Orlando so far) to “lose” wallets. However, when unsuspecting passersby find these wallets and open them, they discover an interesting message:</p>

  <p>Yep, the wallets include notes telling the individuals who find them to go ahead and keep the wallets. <a href="http://www3.timeoutny.com/chicago/blog/out-and-about/?p=10331">Time Out Chicago</a> reported on November 12th that Burger King planned to drop 5,000 of these wallets around urban hot spots in Chicago. According to reports from bloggers, the wallets contain actual cash, ranging from a $1 bill to a $100 bill, a gift card to Burger King, a “Drivers License” featuring The King, and a map of Chicago or Orlando area Burger King’s.</p>

  <p>Several bloggers have posted about their experience, or their friend’s experience, finding one of these wallets. See <a href="http://www.ted.me/free-wallet-from-burger-king/">HERE</a>, <a href="http://www.beneaththebrand.com/2008/11/burger-king-wallet-hits-orlando/">HERE</a> and <a href="http://dennisfrymire.blogspot.com/2008/11/i-found-burger-kings-wallet-this.html">HERE </a>for more on their stories. A couple of PR and marketing bloggers are weighing in as well, <a href="http://progresspr.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/burger-kings-creative-pr-tactic/">praising the promotion </a>and calling it “<a href="http://isaacspr.blogspot.com/2008/11/king-of-surprises.html">unexpected and well-timed</a>” given the current state of the economy.</p>

  <p>This story hasn’t even bubbled up to the mainstream media yet. A Google News search for “Burger King” + “wallet” yields only one mainstream media story, from an <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Finders-Keepers-Fast-Food-Chain-Loses-5000-Wallets.html">NBC station in Chicago</a>. Nor have stories about this promotion appeared yet on major marketing sites such as <a href="http://adage.com/">Adage</a> or <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/">Adfreak</a>.</p>

  <p>This is a brilliant marketing move, and the mainstream media is obviously lagging behind on discovering it – but creative and unique marketing ideas like this one don’t go unnoticed forever. I expect much more widespread attention for this promotion as the word-of-mouth affect begins to trickle up the mainstream media.</p>

<p>&lt;/div&gt;This is one of the most interesting viral marketing campaigns I have seen in a while. Going a step further than your standard “secret” website where you can download your very own free wallpaper or buddy icon (oh boy!), BK has decided to actually give out cash. Literally. That’s a pretty bold move. I know I’d see them more favorably if they gave me $100. Heck, I’m seeing them more favorably just hearing about the idea. It’s really a great plan. I hope they bring it to New York. Doubt it, but I can dream, can’t I?!</p>
