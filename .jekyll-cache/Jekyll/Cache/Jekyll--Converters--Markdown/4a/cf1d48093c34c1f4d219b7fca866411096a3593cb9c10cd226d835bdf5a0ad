I"π<div src="v5">As I sit here watching <span style="font-style: italic;">It‚Äôs A Wonderful Life</span> with my family, I want to wish everyone reading this blog a very holy, blessed and Merry Christmas. For many this has been a difficult year; financial stress has never been higher for many of us and it can be especially discouraging at this time of year when we‚Äôd like to give our loved ones the best that money can buy. This year it‚Äôs more important than ever that we are grateful for the company of those closest to us. It really isn‚Äôt important that we get the hottest and most expensive gadgets for each other, or even that we eat a big Christmas dinner. What matters is that we gather together to wish each other all the best at this sacred time of year when we celebrate the birth of the King of Kings. So this Christmas, take a moment to realize how lucky you really are. The money may be tight, things may seem difficult, but remember the words of Clarence Oddbody, AS2: ‚ÄúNo man is a failure who has friends.‚Äù

Merry Christmas and may the Christ child bring you and your loved ones every blessing.
