I"Ï<p>I say it to myself all the time. Each time, I know that the more I say it, the deeper I dig myself. And yet I keep going. I‚Äôm just not busy enough, apparently. Well, in the last couple of months I‚Äôve been saying, ‚ÄúSure, I can do that,‚Äù a lot more than ever before. As busy as that makes me, I‚Äôve found that I actually enjoy diving head-first into a project and just giving it everything I‚Äôve got. My most recent projects are two new podcasts. I know. Shocking. Since December, I‚Äôve been working with some friends on starting a network of audio dramas based on our favorite comic books. We call ourselves <strong><a href="http://thoughtbubbleaudio.com">Thought Bubble Audio</a></strong>. Our debut project is a Superman/Batman tale based on the origins of Supergirl <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Batman-Vol-2-Supergirl/dp/1401202500/ref=tmm_pap_title_0">as told by Jeph Loeb and Michael Turner</a>. It‚Äôs an awesome story and adapting it for audio has been a challenging but incredibly fun process. I‚Äôve been blogging about it on our site, tracking our progress, and it continues to blow my mind that we‚Äôre actually doing something. Pre-production is just about wrapped up now and we‚Äôre beginning the daunting process of actually recording and producing what we hope will be an exciting and fun show. Check out the <a href="http://thoughtbubbleaudio.com">site</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/TBA_Studios">follow us on Twitter</a> for updates and news about when we‚Äôll be ready for release!</p>

<p>Another project I‚Äôve been working on for the last several weeks is something I‚Äôve been thinking about for quite some time: a tech podcast. My good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/vactor">Justin Vactor</a> of the <a href="http://geeklandpodcast.com">Geekland</a>, <a href="http://fusedfilm.com/tag/entertainment-overload-podcast/">Entertainment Overload</a>, and <a href="http://gothampodcast.com">Gotham Central</a> podcasts joined forces with me to create <a href="http://tech-ramblings.com"><strong>Tech Ramblings</strong></a>: a show where we talk tech with our own fun spin. Justin and I have known each other for over a year now, and I‚Äôve always considered him a very knowledgeable and capable podcaster. He produces <em>very</em> high quality shows, and it‚Äôs been a pleasure to work with him. We just have a great time talking 3 tech news issues each week, often giving our own opinions on what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs a rapid-fire snapshot of what‚Äôs going on in the tech industry from week to week. I look forward to recording with Justin every week and I hope you‚Äôll look forward to hearing what we have to say!</p>

<p>On top of these new shows, I‚Äôm actually working on developing as many as 3 more, if everything works out. If everything comes together to make these shows happen, I‚Äôll be podcasting with some very cool friends who I‚Äôve been looking forward to working with for a while now. Things are about to get crazy over here and I‚Äôm dying to get into it all. I‚Äôll be trying out some new things I‚Äôve never done before. Sure, my life as a student, intern, and employee already keep me busy, but these projects make it all seem worth it. They keep me sane and give me something to look forward to. So here‚Äôs to more podcasting!</p>
