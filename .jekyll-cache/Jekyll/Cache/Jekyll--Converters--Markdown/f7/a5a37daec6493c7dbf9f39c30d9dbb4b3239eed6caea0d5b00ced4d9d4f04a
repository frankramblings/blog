I"ª<div src="v5">For the last couple of months Iâ€™ve been working on improving my Geek Cred by catching up on the many TV shows &amp; films I missed out on when I was busy trying to pretend I had a life. When last we spoke, I was working my way through Joss Whedonâ€™s <span style="font-style: italic;">Firefly.</span> It continues to roll along smoothly: - <span style="font-style: italic;">Terminator</span> â€” <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">DONE</span>
- Terminator 2 â€” <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">DONE</span>
- Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles â€”<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> DONE</span>
- Firefly â€” <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">DONE</span>
- Serenity â€” <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">DONE</span>
- Buffy the Vampire Slayer â€” <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IN PROGRESS</span>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>
- Supernatural

I took a bit of a break after <span style="font-style: italic;">Firefly/Serenity</span> and meant to start working on <span style="font-style: italic;">Supernatural</span>, but as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span>â€˜s premiere drew closer and Echo Alert was conceived, I decided it was essential that I complete my Whedon training before moving on to other shows. At the moment Iâ€™m finishing Buffy Season 5 Episode 15 â€œI Was Made To Love You.â€ This is really a great show and I can see why so many fans consider it a yardstick by which all other Joss media should be measured. Iâ€™ll talk more about when Iâ€™ve finished the series and have the proper perspective. Iâ€™m especially looking forward to the musical episode â€œOnce More with Feelingâ€, the crossover episodes with <span style="font-style: italic;">Angel</span>, and the Buffy Season 8 comics. But for now, the catchup continues.
