If I didn’t <em>just</em> get an Echo Dot a week ago, I’d be clamoring for a release date here. It makes a lot of sense for GE to get into this space, especially when you consider their involvement in the household appliance space. It would be a great experience to have your oven, your fridge, and your washer/dryer connected to Alexa.</p>
