I"†<p>Finally, the day is coming. Twitter officially announced today that they soon will be loosening up their iconic 140-character limit. Iâ€™ve always been a proponent of Tweeting in 140 characters or less, but the way they are going about this is exactly the way it should be. Rather than abolishing the limit all together or agreeing on a new number, they are allowing @names and media attachments to be exempt from the limit. This keeps the spirit of the 140 limit while acknowledging the reality of Twitter in 2016. Honestly, itâ€™s overdue, but Iâ€™m glad to see it happening. Maybe soon youâ€™ll be able to edit typos in Tweets? Fingers crossedâ€¦</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIn the coming months weâ€™ll make changes to simplify
	Tweets including what counts toward your 140 characters, 
	so for instance, @names in replies and media attachments 
	(like photos, GIFs, videos, and polls) will no longer 
	â€œuse upâ€ valuable characters.â€</p>
