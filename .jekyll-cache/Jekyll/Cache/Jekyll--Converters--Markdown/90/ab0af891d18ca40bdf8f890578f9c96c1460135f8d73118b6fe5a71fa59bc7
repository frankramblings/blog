I"—<p>Yes, the iPhone X looks awesome. Yes, I want one. But anyone can talk about the good stuff. How about some of the annoying, nitpicky details?</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/really-happened-apples-face-id-fail-onstage-181213050.html">Poor Craig Federighi.</a> Was his face <em>too</em> handsome for Face ID?</li>
  <li>A cellular Apple Watch wonâ€™t be useful to me until itâ€™s as easy to play podcasts on the watch as it is on the iPhone. Until I can easily get podcasts on my Apple Watch and AirPods, I canâ€™t leave my iPhone very far behind anyway. Iâ€™ll be sticking with my Series 2 for now. Plus, as a Type 1 diabetic, Iâ€™m hopeful that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/15/apple-watch-glucose-monitoring-smart-bands/">rumored glucose monitoring features</a> will come to Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018.</li>
  <li>I was crossing my fingers and wishing (foolishly, Iâ€™ll admit) that theyâ€™d reveal that the existing AirPods charging case has secretly had wireless charging capability all along. I know, I know â€” I ought to know better.</li>
  <li>On iPhone X, Control Center is now accessed by dragging down from the top right corner of the screen. But, Reachability doesnâ€™t exist on iPhone X. So Iâ€™ll be regularly swiping down from the top, but Iâ€™m not sure I can always reach that corner. Something Iâ€™ll need hands-on experience to fully wrap my head around.</li>
</ul>
