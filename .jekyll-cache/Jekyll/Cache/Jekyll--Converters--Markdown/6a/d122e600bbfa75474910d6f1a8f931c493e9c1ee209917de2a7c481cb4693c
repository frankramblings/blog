I"ï<p>My Apple Watch Series 2 arrived two days ago and I havenâ€™t had the nerve to test this feature yet. Luckily, Nathan Smart quite literally took the plunge in my place. Itâ€™s less interesting than Apple made it sound, but cool to see that it actually works! Meanwhile, Iâ€™ll be keeping my watch safe and dry for now.</p>
