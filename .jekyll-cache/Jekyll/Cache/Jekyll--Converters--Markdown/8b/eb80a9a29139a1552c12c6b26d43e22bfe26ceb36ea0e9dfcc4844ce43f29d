I"<p>We learned in November that <a href="http://frankramblings.com/blog/2015/11/27/-finally-instagram-is-testing-multiple-account-switching-android-police">Instagram was testing multiple account switching on Android</a>. This week, reports have surfaced that the same feature being tested on iOS as well. Iâ€™m really eager to test it out and switch easily between my <a href="http://instagram.com/frankramblings">@FrankRamblings</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/bostonpolaroid">@BostonPolaroid</a> accounts, but I donâ€™t seem to have it yet. Latergramme posted a quick and easy way to check if youâ€™re one of the chosen few. If youâ€™re reading this and youâ€™ve been able to test it out, comment below!</p>

and click on â€œSettings.â€ Near the bottom, you will have the option to â€œAdd Account.â€

After adding an account, youâ€™ll easily be able to switch between multiple Instagram 
accounts, accessing separate photo feeds, comments, and messages without logging out 
of the Instagram iOS app. When you receive likes or comments, your push notifications
