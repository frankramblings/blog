I"—<p>So this is either my third or fourth attempt at regularly maintaining a blog. It depends how you look at it. I tried twice in high school. Once in 2004 for a couple of days, and then again in 2006 for a few weeks. Then in 2006 I started a podcast and made a blog to serve as a website for that. I still maintain it at <a href="http://www.frankpodcast.tk/">frankpodcast.tk</a>, but I donâ€™t feel that itâ€™s appropriate to use it for my personal thoughts. A friend told me today that he was starting his own blog, and I was inspired to go back to my own blogging ways. Originally, I meant to continue where I left off with the old blog I started in â€™04, but for some reason I couldnâ€™t log in to it. I read through it, though. Itâ€™s amazing how much things have changed in just a couple of years. If you want to check that out, head on over to <a href="http://mistaguitarmasta.blogspot.com/">mistaguitarmasta.blogspot.com</a> and take a walk down Memory Lane. My memories, that is.</p>

<p>So where do I go from here? Well, I donâ€™t really know. Iâ€™ll be upfront and admit that the only reason Iâ€™m starting this up again is to keep myself entertained and to keep sort of a journal of the things that interest me, as well as the things that go on in my life. If I find an interesting news story, Iâ€™ll post it here. If I had a good sandwich, Iâ€™ll talk about it here. This is for me to write about whatever I feel like. I would greatly appreciate any comments you might have. So make use of the comment boxes. Even send an email to frankramblings@gmail.com if you like. Feedback is always appreciated. Letâ€™s see how long I keep it up this time. A long time, hopefully.</p>
