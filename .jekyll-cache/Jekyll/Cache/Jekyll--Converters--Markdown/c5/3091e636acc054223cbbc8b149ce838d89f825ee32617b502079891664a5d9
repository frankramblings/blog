I"<div src="v5">[![](http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a155/mistaguitarmasta/echoalertcoverart.jpg)](http://www.echoalert.tk)So apparently not even two podcasts are enough for me. My addiction for podcasting and my interest in a particular new TV show brought me to the realization that it was time to start a third show. My friend Andrew and I have teamed up to bring you Echo Alert, a podcast devoted to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span>, Joss Whedon’s new FOX series starring Eliza Dushku and Tahmoh Penikett. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span> looks like such a promising new show that Andrew and I know we’ll love it. Each week, we’ll discuss the show<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> at length, giving you a recap of the most recent episode and providing our own commentary while speculating on what twists and turns the show may take in the future. At the very end of each episode, there will be a spoilers discussion. Don’t worry, there will be plenty of warning before we start talking spoilers. So please, if you have any interest in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span>, or even if you just want to find out what the show is all about, download our Episode 0 Part 1 entitled “Activated.” It’s a <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span> joke. You’ll get it eventually. [Echo Alert Website](http://www.echoalert.tk/)
