  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€œStarting today the company will let creators add URL links to their stories that viewers can navigate &gt;  to without leaving Instagram, add the ability for users to be â€œ@ mentionedâ€ in someoneâ€™s story, and add &gt;  the ability to add a Boomerang to your story without having to go create one in the separate Boomerang &gt;  app.â€
