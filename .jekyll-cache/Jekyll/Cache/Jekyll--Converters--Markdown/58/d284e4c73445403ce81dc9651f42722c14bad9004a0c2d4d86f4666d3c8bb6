I"€<p>Each Thursday night, after Smallville has already aired, I look forward to downloading the newest episode of <em>Speeding Bulletin</em>. The first segment of this weekly video podcast is hosted by the <a href="http://www.supermanhomepage.com">Superman Homepageâ€™s</a> webmaster Steve Younis. <em>Speeding Bulletin</em> provides viewers with a weekly summary of Superman news from the past 7 days. Itâ€™s a must-view for any true Superman fan, as it covers news of upcoming comics, TV, movies, and fan events, such as charity events and conventions. If you want to know whatâ€™s going on in the world of Superman, this is the show to watch. Once Steve has covered all the news, his friend and Superman Homepage contributor Neal Bailey gives a quick rant about some piece of Superman news that has caught his fancy. He is hilarious and his immense knowledge of all things Superman make his segment extremely entertaining. <em>Speeding Bulletin</em> averages 10 minutes in total between the two segments. Once a month, Steve and Neal team up for an audio podcast called <em>Radio K.A.L.</em> In this show, they pick 3 or 4 recent Superman headlines and discuss them at length, giving their personal opinions and insights on the topics at hand. Other segments include reader e-mails, a monthly contest, and the presentation of a Superman-related song, usually something by a little-known independent band. <em>Radio K.A.L.</em> along with <em>Speeding Bulletin</em> are essential for Superman fans who like to keep up with current goings-on. Both shows receive 5 out of a possible 5 celophane Superman shields and the coveted Frank Ramblings Seal of Approval.</p>
