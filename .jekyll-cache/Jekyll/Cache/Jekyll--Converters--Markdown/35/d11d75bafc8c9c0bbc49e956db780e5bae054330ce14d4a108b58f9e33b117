I"ø<p>Iâ€™ve been podcasting like a fool lately. I really love the medium and Iâ€™m always looking for a chance to speak my mind on a range of topics, so it really shouldnâ€™t be all that surprising, yet when I look at the hours I spend recording and editing podcasts, it is more than a little insane. First and foremost, Iâ€™d like to announce the start of a new podcast hosted by friends William, Hunter, and myself: Lights, Camera, Podcast. As the title suggests, LCP is a movie podcast. Each week we have a great time making fun of each other while occasionally going into some movie talk, too. While thatâ€™s a bit of an exaggeration, we do discuss the biggest new releases we all had the chance to see, as well as any other films â€” both new and old â€” that we managed to catch at our leisure. Itâ€™s a ton of fun to record and we hope youâ€™ll enjoy listening to it. Our first episode covering <em>Star Trek</em> is already available on iTunes, and a second episode about <em>Terminator Salvation</em> and a number of other films should be up soon.</p>

<p>Then of course there is my most consistent show <a href="http://echoalertcast.com">Echo Alert</a>. Though <span style="font-style: italic;">Dollhouse</span> is off the air for the summer, Andrew and I are very excited about the confirmed Season 2 pickup and will continue the show on a bi-weekly basis through the summer until the show returns. Weâ€™ve got some fun stuff lined up including a couple of soon-to-be-announced contests, guest co-hosts, and some other possible goodies, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>I should also mention some guest spots Iâ€™ve been doing lately. Both happen to be related to the world of comic books. At the end of each month, I host a segment of the <a href="http://www.geeklandpodcast.com/">Geekland Podcast </a>entitled This Month in Superman. Itâ€™s my chance to spend a few minutes gushing on events occurring in the Superman family of comics. My most recent segment appears in episode 85. In addition to that, just last night I was asked by my friend William (also of LCP) to step in and co-host this weekâ€™s episode of <a href="http://btpcast.com">Between the Panels</a>, his own comics podcast. It was unexpected and last-minute, but I was really glad I did it, because I had a ton of fun talking comics with him. That episode (number 12) should be out within the next week.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the project nearest and dearest to my heart, <a href="http://frankpodcast.tk/">FMF</a>. It was my very first podcasting foray, and Iâ€™m proud to continue DJ-ing to this day. Itâ€™s always a blast when I get a chance to sit down and record an episode, even though I donâ€™t always get a chance to do that as often as Iâ€™d like to. I look forward to keeping the show up for the foreseeable future going forward.</p>

<p>So as you can see, Iâ€™ve been very busy lately. At least that new equipment I recently purchased is being put to good use. Now I just need to strike it rich and get my own place with a dedicated podcasting studio. What?</p>

<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
