I"∏<p>Barbara West of Orlando‚Äôs Eyewitness News WFTV-Channel 9 recently interviewed Sen. Joe Biden, asking him to respond to accusations that Sen. Obama‚Äôs policies are Marxist:<br />

<p>I applaud Ms. West and WFTV for asking the questions we‚Äôre all dying to have answered. I love how much her calm demeanor bothered Biden, who was visibly hot under the collar and really wanted to tell her off. It clearly took all his willpower not to explode and start ranting about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyEqyYUGk4I">how high his IQ is</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM19YOqs7hU&amp;feature=related">making racist remarks</a>.</p>
