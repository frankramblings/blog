I"ë<p>Itâ€™s always sad (and unfortunately not surprising) to read about injustice in the workplace, and itâ€™s that much more disappointing when those injustices are carried out by organizations that pride themselves on uncovering wrongdoing and championing the rights of the mistreated. In this case, I canâ€™t say itâ€™s the first criticism Iâ€™ve read about the inner workings at Gawker. This is a longer read but well worth the time, as it addresses some real problems that are not unique to Gawker. Any man who works in an office environment should take a moment to read this and evaluate how he treats his female colleagues.</p>

<p>â€œGawker may pride itself on being a trailblazer in the stubbornly slow-to-adapt media, but only if starts to treat gender favoritism as the toxic epidemic that it is, will that reputation truly be deserved.â€</p>
