I"O<p>Lately I’ve been checking out Digg.com a lot. Pretty much daily. Lately it’s been Obama-central, but hopefully that will slow down after next week. It’s usually a great place for interesting and funny news. If you like bizarre but true stories, have a look. Here’s a prime example:</p>

<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5069422/the-muppets-animal-caught-speeding-driving-police-crazy">The Muppet’s Animal Caught Speeding, Driving Police Crazy</a></p>

<p>See? Hilarious and true! Stuff like this pops up constantly on Digg. Then there’s also interesting pop culture stuff:
“<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/its-official-ro.html">It’s official: Robert Downey Jr. will suit up for ‘The Avengers,’ Jon Favreau on board as an executive producer</a>
That particular story makes me very happy, by the way. I loved <em>Iron Man</em> And I’m not a fan of the character, nor Marvel Comics in general. I’m looking forward to this <em>Avengers</em> movie. I know pretty much nothing about The Avengers, and in a way I want to keep it that way so I can enjoy the version of the story they decide to give us in the film. Anyway, check out Digg. They’re rather awesome. Incidentally, they have a podcast, <em>DiggNation</em>, which I’ll be reviewing soon as the next installment of my “Podcastin’” series.</p>
