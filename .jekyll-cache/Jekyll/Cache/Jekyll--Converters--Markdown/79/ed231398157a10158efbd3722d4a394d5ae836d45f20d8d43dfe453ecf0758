I"Ô<p>This piece in <em>The Atlantic</em> does a good job of summarizing the way I feel about the way DC Comics has been handling Superman over the last several years. There are some things I donâ€™t agree with here, but I think the overall message is pretty on point: they very obviously donâ€™t know what to do with the character. The more they try reinventing him, the more disservice they do him.</p>

less to do with the character himself and more to with DC Comics, 
which found itself stuck with a flagship character it thought needed 
fixing. In trying, it broke him nearly beyond repair.
