I"Ñ<p>Not sure why this feature isnâ€™t turned on by default. It would make all the sense in the world. Also not sure why itâ€™s hidden and worded so strangely. In any case, I just did this and recommend it. Even if you donâ€™t use Siri, itâ€™s useful to keep her silent if you donâ€™t want her talking to you when you accidentally enable her in a quiet room.</p>

<p>â€œ1. Open Settings and go to â€œGeneralâ€ then to â€œSiriâ€ 2. Choose â€œVoice Feedbackâ€ and select â€œControl with Ring Switchâ€ (yes, the Mute switch on the side of the iPhone and iPad is referred to as the â€˜Ring Switchâ€™ here, but itâ€™s the mute button you know and love)â€</p>
