I"ƒ<p>This is going to seem stupid to many of you, but here goes anyway. When it comes to spelling and grammar, I have a pretty serious case of O.C.D. Iâ€™m not very forgiving of those errors, mostly because spelling and grammar come very naturally to me. I know if a sentence is grammatically correct or if a word is spelled properly just by reading or hearing it. It usually doesnâ€™t take very much effort on my part. Thatâ€™s why I was so surprised today when I read Green Lantern #45, written by the illustrious Geoff Johns, and ran across the following grammatical error from the mouth of Hal Jordanâ€™s on-again, off-again love interest Carol Ferris:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>â€œHal and I broke up more times then heâ€™s charged his ring.â€
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe some of you donâ€™t even see the error, but to me, â€œthenâ€ stands out like a sore thumb. So whatâ€™s the point of all this? I mentioned it in passing during a conversation with my friend Faith, and the following dialogue came out of it. I thought it was funny, so upon her suggestion, Iâ€™m posting it here. (Forgive our grammatical laziness, specifically the lack of capitalization. This was just a private instant message conversation.)</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I saw a spelling/grammar error in a comic today</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: no way!</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: yeah. my previously unwavering faith in geoff johns was shaken.</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: oh no!</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: itâ€™ll take some time but I think we can patch things up</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: so sad</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: I know you two will make it work out</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: youâ€™re made for each other</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I hope youâ€™re right</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: things have been so great until now</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I donâ€™t want it to end so suddenly</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: itâ€™s the first stutter in your relationship, give it time, things will go back to normal</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: just because he used â€œthenâ€ when he clearly meant â€œthanâ€</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: oh, thatâ€™s not as bad as I thought</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: itâ€™s just one bad issue. Itâ€™ll go back to normal next time</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: that shouldnâ€™t get past the proofreader!!</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: see, thatâ€™s not him</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: thatâ€™s an external force</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: but he wrote it in the first place!</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: honey, youâ€™re arguing semantics in a one time situation</p>

<p><strong>Faith</strong>: everyone slips up a bit</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: this is sounding too much like a real almost-break-up so Iâ€™m going to stop before I seriously frighten myself</p>
