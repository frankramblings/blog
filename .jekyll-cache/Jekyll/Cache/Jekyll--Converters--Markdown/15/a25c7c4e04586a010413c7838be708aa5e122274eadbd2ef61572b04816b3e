I"Ô<p>I took the plunge. I installed Windows Vista yesterday. Not as my primary OS; that would be madness. Iâ€™m dual-booting XP and Vista. For those not familiar with the term, it means that when I turn my computer on, I get a choice of which OS I want to use. Iâ€™ve been trying out Vista since yesterday afternoon and I must say itâ€™s really a pretty good system. Great, actually. I have no major complaints. My only issue so far was that Vista asked me to confirm almost every action. When I installed or ran a program for the first time, I had to confirm that I trusted the software. Got annoying. But it was pretty easy to disable that through Control Panel. Since then, itâ€™s been smooth sailing. Iâ€™m actually considering switching over to Vista permanently. I wonâ€™t make that decision until Iâ€™ve been able to fully try it out and decide that Iâ€™m absolutely certain itâ€™s a good move. The main complaint one hears about Vista is that it hogs system resources. Admittedly, I havenâ€™t been able to test that out to its fullest yet because I donâ€™t have much room on my Vista partition to install lots of software. Thus far Iâ€™ve only installed Firefox, Chrome, iTunes, and AIM. The basics. Plus any Windows Updates, because this copy of Vista is a little old, so it needs to be made current. At some point today I might install Photoshop or another program that requires a lot of system resources and then weâ€™ll see how Vista fares. But so far, itâ€™s actually consistently faster than my XP partition. Plus, because of the way I have things set up, I actually have access to all of the documents and files that are in my XP partition even when Iâ€™m running Vista, so Iâ€™m not really handicapping myself. The only problem is that I canâ€™t run programs off of my XP partition for use in Vista, and there isnâ€™t enough room on my hard drive to install <em>everything</em> in both XP and Vista. Maybe Iâ€™ll try and use my external hard drive for that.</p>

<p>Anyway, overall Iâ€™m enjoying Vista very much. Iâ€™m inclined to agree with my good friend Shannon, a full-time Vista user and the only person I know who is totally fine with it. Iâ€™ll keep you posted as things develop. Before you go, a screenshot:</p>

<p>I know, only 1GB of RAM. Itâ€™s disgraceful. But by Christmas (if not earlier) that will be expanded to my motherboardâ€™s maximum of 4GB. And it will be glorious. Thatâ€™s when Iâ€™ll REALLY know if Vista is worth my time. If I like it enough with 4GB of RAM, I might start uninstalling stuff from my XP partition and switch to Vista as my primary OS.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Iâ€™m really excited for Windows 7, the next OS from Microsoft. Thatâ€™s set to drop in late 2009 or early 2010. Beta versions have leaked onto BitTorrent and I am more than a little tempted to try them out. The trick is finding a legitimate version that WONâ€™T turn out to be a lovely piece of malware. If Vista doesnâ€™t work out for me, I just might have to grab a copy of Windows 7 and dual-boot it along with XP. We shall see. Any good/bad Vista experiences anyone wants to share?
