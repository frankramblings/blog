I"˜8<p>I am no huge fan of President Bush. Anyone who knows me will tell you that. Not the best president in American history by any standards. But heâ€™s also not the vampiric mass-murderer heâ€™s made out to be. Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, an intern for the 2004 Kerry campaign agrees with me. He said so in this morningâ€™s Wall Street Journal:</p>

  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Earlier this year, 12,000 people in San Francisco 
signed a petition in support of a proposition on a 
local ballot to rename an Oceanside sewage plant 
after George W. Bush. The proposition is only one 
example of the classless disrespect many Americans 
have shown the president.

According to recent Gallup polls, the presidentâ€™s 
average approval rating is below 30% â€” down from his 
90% approval in the wake of 9/11. Mr. Bush has endured 
relentless attacks from the left while facing abandonment 
from the right.

 This is the price Mr. Bush is paying for trying to work 
with both Democrats and Republicans. During his 2004 
victory speech, the president reached out to voters who 
supported his opponent, John Kerry, and said, â€œToday, I 
want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent. 
To make this nation stronger and better, I will need your 
support, and I will work to earn it. I will do all I can 
do to deserve your trust.â€

Those bipartisan efforts have been met with crushing 
resistance from both political parties.

The presidentâ€™s original Supreme Court choice of 
Harriet Miers alarmed Republicans, while his final 
nomination of Samuel Alito angered Democrats. His 
solutions to reform the immigration system alienated 
traditional conservatives, while his refusal to retreat 
in Iraq has enraged liberals who have unrealistic 
expectations about the challenges we face there.

It seems that no matter what Mr. Bush does, he is blamed 
for everything. He remains despised by the left while 
continuously disappointing the right.

Yet it should seem obvious that many of our countryâ€™s 
current problems either existed long before Mr. Bush 
ever came to office, or are beyond his control. 
Perhaps if Americans stopped being so divisive, and 
congressional leaders came together to work with the 
president on some of these problems, he would actually 
have had a fighting chance of solving them.

Like the president said in his 2004 victory speech, 
â€œWe have one country, one Constitution and one future 
that binds us. And when we come together and work 
together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.â€

To be sure, Mr. Bush is not completely alone. His low 
approval ratings put him in the good company of former 
Democratic President Harry S. Truman, whose own approval 
rating sank to 22% shortly before he left office. 
Despite Mr. Trumanâ€™s low numbers, a 2005 Wall Street 
Journal poll found that he was ranked the seventh most 
popular president in history.

Just as Americans have gained perspective on how 
challenging Trumanâ€™s presidency was in the wake of 
World War II, our country will recognize the hardship 
President Bush faced these past eight years â€” and how 
extraordinary it was that he accomplished what he did 
in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

 The treatment President Bush has received from this 
country is nothing less than a disgrace. The attacks 
launched against him have been cruel and slanderous, 
proving to the world what little character and resolve 
we have. The president is not to blame for all these 
problems. He never lost faith in America or her people, 
and has tried his hardest to continue leading our nation 
during a very difficult time.

Our failure to stand by the one person who continued to 
stand by us has not gone unnoticed by our enemies. 
It has shown to the world how disloyal we can be when 
our president needed loyalty â€” a shameful display of 
arrogance and weakness that will haunt this nation    long after Mr. Bush has left the White House.

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On a cold, gray morning a week before Election Day, 
President Bush briefly emerged from the for an 
unannounced visit to the headquarters of the in 
Southeast Washington.
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Outside the RNC building, Bush continued to face record-low approval ratings and a presidential campaign focused on his failings. But inside an overflowing conference room, he was greeted with roaring applause as he urged his fellow Republicans to keep pushing for the finish line.</p>

  <p>â€œHis general message was to thank the staff for everything weâ€™ve been doing and encourage us to keep working hard all the way through Election Day,â€ said one person who attended the closed event. â€œIt was upbeat and very exciting.â€</p>

  <p>Even for a declared optimist, Bush has appeared remarkably sanguine in this season of discontent. The economy is melting down, his own party has shunned him, and Tuesdayâ€™s election is shaping up as a searing rebuke to his eight years in office.</p>

  <p>Yet according to allies inside and outside the White House, Bushâ€™s mood remains buoyant and his attention is focused on the global financial collapse. In private meetings with business leaders, Bush has made a point of saying that he is happy the crisis happened on his watch so the next president and a new economic team do not have to grapple with it.</p>

  <p>â€œHis high energy level and spirit sets the tone for the rest of us,â€ said <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Kevin+Sullivan?tid=informline">Kevin Sullivan</a>, Bushâ€™s communications director. â€œThereâ€™s been no time to worry about any of this other stuff. . . . He believes the American people expect us to finish strong and to leave things in the best possible position for his successor.â€</p>

  <p>Others inside and outside the administration, however, say the upbeat talk masks disappointment and frustration among many White House staffers, who believe Bushâ€™s reputation has been unfairly maligned for a series of calamities â€” from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to the financial crisis â€” that were beyond his control and that he handled well. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Republican+Party?tid=informline">GOP</a> nominee <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/John+McCain?tid=informline">John McCain</a>â€˜s escalating attacks on Bushâ€™s tenure have added to the irritation, these people said.</p>

  <p>â€œEverybody kind of wanted to spend the last 100-plus days doing some legacy things, and the financial crisis has thrown a wrench into that,â€ said one prominent Republican who regularly talks with senior White House officials.</p>

  <p>â€œYou have a combination of no legacy stuff, a horrible economic mess and the likelihood that Obama is going to win,â€ this person added. â€œThere is a real sadness there.â€</p>

  <p>None of this would matter, of course, if not for Bushâ€™s deep and abiding unpopularity. Bush has not commanded approval from a majority of the nation since early 2005, making him arguably the most disliked president since polling on the question began in the 1930s. A <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+Washington+Post+Company?tid=informline">Washington Post</a>â€“<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/ABC+Inc.?tid=informline">ABC News</a> tracking poll last week put Bushâ€™s approval rating at 24 percent and found that McCain had made little headway in separating himself from Bush or his policies.</p>

  <p>Itâ€™s not for lack of trying. For the first time in recent memory, a sitting president has effectively sat out the presidential race, avoiding public appearances on behalf of McCain and other Republicans and raising far less money than usual in private fundraisers. Bush voted for McCain by absentee ballot rather than voting in person in Texas, as he has for the past three elections, and officials say he plans to spend election night at the White House rather than at a rally or other campaign-related event.</p>

  <p>Bush held his last closed GOP fundraiser of the season nearly two weeks ago and cleared his schedule of public events from Friday through Election Day. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Dick+Cheney?tid=informline">Vice President Cheney</a>, by contrast, held a rally for McCain in Wyoming yesterday â€” an event to which the campaign of Democratic nominee <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Barack+Obama?tid=informline">Barack Obama</a> was quick to call attention.</p>

  <p>â€œThis is unprecedented for a president to be this invisible during a campaign,â€ said <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Charlie+Cook?tid=informline">Charlie Cook</a>, editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. â€œThis is what happens when you have a 25 percent approval rating.â€</p>

  <p>White House spokesman <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Tony+Fratto?tid=informline">Tony Fratto</a> said Friday that plenty of Republicans wanted Bush to host fundraisers, but the president decided to focus on the economic crisis in recent weeks. Because of ongoing news events, Fratto added, â€œheâ€™s had to be a lot more visible than we would have liked during the most intense period of the campaign.â€</p>

  <p>Aides say privately that Bush long ago made peace with his low approval ratings, which have persisted despite significant improvements in Iraq, the original source of his polling woes. Some current and former aides argue that Bushâ€™s unpopularity has made it easier for him to push ahead with difficult decisions, such as a series of dramatic interventions into the financial markets that have angered conservatives over the past two months.</p>

  <p>â€œYouâ€™re more liberated to act when youâ€™ve internalized those low approval ratings,â€ said Pete Wehner, a former top Bush adviser. â€œThis is a White House and a president that are in some ways galvanized by a crisis.â€</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Ari+Fleischer?tid=informline">Ari Fleischer</a>, one of Bushâ€™s former press secretaries, said that although Bush is â€œnot prone to talk about legacy,â€ he and his closest advisers are confident that history â€œwill remember him well.â€</p>

  <p>â€œWould he like to be more popular?â€ Fleischer added. â€œOf course he would. Of course it bugs him. But it doesnâ€™t guide him or drive him.â€</p>

  <p>There is little outward sign of irritation from Bush, who has maintained a sense of good cheer in many of his less-formal public appearances this year. During a celebration honoring <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Theodore+Roosevelt?tid=informline">Theodore Roosevelt</a>â€˜s 150th birthday last week, Bush joked: â€œPeople ask me, â€˜Do you ever see any of the ghosts of your predecessors here in the White House?â€™ I said, â€˜No, I quit drinking.â€™ â€œ</p>

  <p>That enduring, frat-boy enthusiasm is exactly the sort of thing that riles his detractors, but supporters say Bushâ€™s optimism has been central to his political survival. â€œWhen youâ€™re inside, and the president is so optimistic, youâ€™re not paying as much attention to the noise outside,â€ said Candida â€œCandiâ€ Wolff, a former White House legislative affairs director. â€œIt keeps everybody focused.â€</p>

  <p>Bushâ€™s public schedule over the past few months has included a parade of farewell meetings with friendly foreign leaders, from Italian Prime Minister <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Silvio+Berlusconi?tid=informline">Silvio Berlusconi</a>to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Ellen+Johnson-Sirleaf?tid=informline">Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a>. Bush has also let down his guard on a few occasions, showing traces of the kind of nostalgia he normally eschews.</p>

  <p>In early October, for example, Bush made a side trip to one of his boyhood homes in Midland, Tex., which has been turned into a presidential historic site. Standing in front of the modest rambler that housed two future presidents, Bush recalled a farewell rally that he attended in Midland on his way to Washington in 2001.</p>

  <p>â€œI said, â€˜You know, Iâ€™m not going to change as a person because of politics or Washingtonâ€™ â€” thatâ€™s what I said when I left,â€ Bush said. â€œI think they appreciate that. I want them to know that, you know, even though I had to deal with a lot of tough issues, that Iâ€™m still the same person that they knew before and that, you know, Iâ€™m wiser, more experienced, but my heart and my values didnâ€™t change.â€</p>

If you disagree with him on policy, you are entitled to do so. I certainly do. But characterizing him as a demonic despot is just despicable. I certainly wonâ€™t be painting horns on Obama after his inauguration.&lt;/div&gt;<a href="http://digg.com/"><br />
