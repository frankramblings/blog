I"Á<p>Instagram looks to be differentiating themselves from Snapchat a bit more. <em>Finally</em> being able to share URLs is a big one. I hope we can finally say goodbye to â€œLink in Bio!â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œStarting today the company will let creators add URL links to their stories that viewers can navigate &gt;  to without leaving Instagram, add the ability for users to be â€œ@ mentionedâ€ in someoneâ€™s story, and add &gt;  the ability to add a Boomerang to your story without having to go create one in the separate Boomerang &gt;  app.â€</p>
