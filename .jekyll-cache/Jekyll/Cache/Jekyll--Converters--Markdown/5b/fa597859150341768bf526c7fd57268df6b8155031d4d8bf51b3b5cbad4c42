I"Ñ<p>Twice in the last three weeks, Iâ€™ve guest-hosted <a href="http://castlecast.libsyn.com">Castlecast</a>, a podcast about ABCâ€™s Castle (starring Nathan Fillion). Iâ€™ve been listening to the podcast since it started this summer, and Iâ€™ve really been enjoying it. <a href="http://twitter.com/johnpavlich">John</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hjkuzcotopia">Heidi</a> do a great job recapping and discussing new episodes, delivering Castle-related news, and talking about spoilers for upcoming episodes. Heidi hasnâ€™t been able to host the show lately (feel better, Heidi!), so Johnâ€™s been asking his fellow podcasters to step in. I was on the podcast two weeks ago for <a href="http://castlecast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=539556">Episode 9: Fool Me Once</a> and again this week for <a href="http://castlecast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=544452">Episode 11: Vampire Weekend</a>. The most recent episode was a panel discussion featuring John, <a href="http://twitter.com/starrfyre">Crystal</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/piratescribe">Larissa</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nathanieletc">Nathaniel</a>, and myself. I had a great time on Castlecast and I hope to be on it again some time. Thanks John and Heidi!</p>
