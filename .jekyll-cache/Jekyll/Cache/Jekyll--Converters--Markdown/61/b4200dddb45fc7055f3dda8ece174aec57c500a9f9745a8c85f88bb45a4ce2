I"h<p>With the fall semester drawing to a close and the only two shows I watch regularly (<em>Smallville</em> and <em>Heroes</em>) going on hiatus, I’m going to be missing my regularly-scheduled entertainment fix over the Christmas break. I’ve been hearing a lot about Joss Whedon’s ill-fated <em>Firefly</em> series and its acompanying film <em>Serenity</em>. Friends have told me I need to see it, but I lacked the interest and – more importantly – the time required to watch it. That’s where the internet steps in. <em>Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog</em> formally introduced me to the mind of Joss Whedon. After enjoying that as much as I did I decided I’d add <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Serenity</em> to my mental “To Be Watched” list. Then Aaron and Will over at the <a href="http://www.axedpodcast.com/">Axed</a> podcast did an entire episode on <em>Firefly/Serenity</em> this week. Also, as most of you know, I’ve been addicted to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> for over a month now. It’s an amazing site that you need to check out if you haven’t already. I’ve been talking to lots of very cool people there. Late last week, I started talking to the hosts of the <a href="http://chicgeekpodcast.blogspot.com/">Chic Geek Podcast</a>. I listened to all of their episodes in a matter of three days and enjoyed them immensely. Faith and Ky are really funny and made me genuinely interested in checking out a few things I’ve been holding off on. I think I’m going to do a full review of their show as part of my all-but-abandoned “Podcastin’ ” ongoing blog post series, so be on the lookout for that. Aside from giving me the final push towards watching <em>Firefly/Serenity</em>, the Chic Geek girls have convinced me to look into <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, its popular spin-off <em>Angel</em>, and <em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em> (T:SCC), which is supposed to be the best show on television right now, according to Faith, as well as Steve and Derek of <a href="http://smallvillepodcast.com/">SHoE</a> (who also run a Sarah Connor Chronicles podcast called <a href="http://www.skynextpodcast.com/">SkyNext</a>). So I’ll be keeping quite busy over this break. Of course I hope to be working; in fact I need to remember to call my place of summer employ tomorrow to make sure they still need me over Christmas. However, if that goes through, I usually work early in the day, from 7am-3pm. That leaves plenty of time each day for catching up on good TV. Of course to watch T:SCC, I need to see the Terminator films, which I’m ashamed to say I’ve never seen. I know. Go on, ostracize me. But before you do, know that I watched <em>The Terminator</em> mere moments before writing this post and LOVED it. I’m going to get started on <em>Terminator 2</em> in just a few minutes. <em>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</em> isn’t directly related to T:SCC, so I’ll probably put off watching that until after I’m all caught up with everything else. I’ve only got a month of freedom to watch 7+ years’ worth of TV and movies, so I don’t want to waste my time.</p>

<p>Here’s the order in which I plan to watch all this stuff. If you have any suggestions for how I might amend it, feel free to comment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Terminator</em> — DONE</li>
  <li><em>Terminator 2</em> — DONE</li>
  <li><em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em> — SEASON 1 DONE, S2 IN PROGRESS</li>
  <li><em>Firefly</em></li>
  <li><em>Serenity</em></li>
  <li><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></li>
  <li><em>Angel</em></li>
</ul>
