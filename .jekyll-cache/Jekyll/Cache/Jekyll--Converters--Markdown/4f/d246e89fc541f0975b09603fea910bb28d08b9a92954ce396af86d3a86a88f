I"Á<p>This meme is the best thing to come out of <em>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.</em> The movie wasnâ€™t very good, and its misunderstanding of Superman and Batman is abysmal, but at least this meme inspired by the movie has launched <em>The Sound of Silence</em> to #6 on the Billboard chart.</p>

<p>â€œSimon &amp; Garfunkelâ€™s classic 1966 song â€œThe Sound of Silenceâ€ has jumped up into the Billboard Rock Top 10 chart because of a meme. And a beautiful meme at that. â€œSad Affleckâ€ has taken the internet by storm and racked up nearly 22 million views on YouTube in just two weeks. The video shows a dejected Ben Affleck learning about the horrible reviews Batman V Superman is receiving. â€œThe Sound of Silenceâ€ comes in while Affleck stares at the ground, reflecting on every decision heâ€™s ever made in his life.â€</p>
