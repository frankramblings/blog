I"<p>The next time someone asks why I still read superhero comic books at age 29, I’m going to hand them a copy of Brian Michael Bendis’s <a href="https://www.dccomics.com/comics/superman-2018/superman-2">Superman #2</a>. It opens with powerful reminder of the responsibility we all have to stay plugged into what’s happening in the world, even when it’s totally overwhelming — all under the guise of a superhero story. And it has the realistic, yet inspiring tone you’d want from a Superman story.</p>
