I"˜<p>First, Nintendo announced the NES Classic Edition. Now, Sega is announcing the <a href="http://comicbook.com/2016/07/26/sega-reveals-genesis-classic-edition-rerelease/">Mega Drive Classic Game Console</a>, a re-release of the classic console better known to North American gamers as the Sega Genesis. Itâ€™s similar to the classic NES in many respects with a couple of key differences: it comes with two controllers (compared to the NESâ€™s one), it comes pre-loaded with 80 classic games (the NES only comes with 30), and it has a working cartridge slot. Thatâ€™s right. Dust off your old Genesis games and you can play them again. This all coincides with the 25th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog, whose games are pretty well-represented in the bundle that come built-into the console.</p>

<p>This gradual return of classic game consoles is beginning to feel like the resurgence of vinyl records! Really exciting for people who grew up with these games and want a legal way to play them on a big screen.</p>
